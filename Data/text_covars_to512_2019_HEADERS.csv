Maintaining the security of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems.

2488,"In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum, commonly referred to as ""Brexit,"" has created economic and political uncertainty in the European Union. Also, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Also the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs imposed by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, below. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures.

Failure of any party to the shipbuilding agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in Korea which prevent one or more significant subcontractors to each of, Philly Shipyard or NASSCO from performing, or (iv) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard, NASSCO, or any of their respective subcontractors.

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves.  Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues.  In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.  Crude oil prices declined in 2016, relative to preceding years, resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves.  In contrast, crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 and 2018 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves.  If crude oil prices in 2019 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2018, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business.

As with other companies in the financial services industry, Aflac's ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO. The Company determines its pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, life expectancy of plan participants and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce the Company's profitability. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured on an amortized cost basis to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses in order to reflect the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset(s). The Company currently expects loans and loan receivables and held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities to be the asset classes most significantly impacted upon adoption of the guidance.

The frequency of the reviews and updates varies according to the assumptions but will be at least annually in all cases. The Company anticipates that the requirement to review and update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits will have a significant impact on its results of operations, systems, processes, and controls, while the requirement to update the discount rate will have a significant impact on the other comprehensive income component of its equity.

5981,"The Company's key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company's larger competitors - A significant portion of the Company's products are sold to national distributors in the United States, which also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors' income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company's product lines. With the recent consolidation among domestic distribution companies, these considerations have become more pronounced. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors. The Company's investment in foreign businesses may pose additional risks - With the expansion of its footprint internationally and, in particular, with the business acquired in Central America in 2017 and Brazil in 2018, the Company now carries on business at a material level in some jurisdictions that have a history of political or economic instability. While such instability may not be present at the current time, there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in one or more jurisdictions quickly and without notice, nor is there any guarantee that the Company would be able to recoup its investment in such territories in light of such changes. Adverse changes of this nature could have a material effect upon the Company's overall financial performance. The manufacturing of the Company's products is subject to governmental regulations - The Company currently owns and operates three manufacturing facilities which are located in Los Angeles, California; Axis, Alabama; and Marsing, Idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in Hannibal, Missouri (the ""Facilities""). The Facilities operate under the laws and regulations imposed by relevant state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company's products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company's manufacture of one or more of its products and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to provide customers with its products in a timely and affordable manner.",0.2390292,19.9025718888889,32,1.40595530222222

We could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective. These provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. Generally, United States insurance holding company laws require that, before a person can acquire control of an insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, ""control"" over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock. Thus, the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock. Some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the target insurer and its affiliates, on the other hand, have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state.

The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc.

Our failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent could adversely affect our business. Governmental actions around the world to enforce trade practice, anti-money-laundering, anti-corruption, competition, tax, environmental, and other laws are also a continuing compliance risk for global companies such as ours.

The loss of a substantial amount of aged inventory  -  through fire, other natural or man-made disaster, contamination, or otherwise  -  could significantly reduce the supply of the affected product or products. A consequence of any of these or other supply or supply chain disruptions could prevent us from meeting consumer demand for the affected products for a period of time. In addition, insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover the replacement value of our inventory of maturing products and other assets if they were to be lost.

As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations.  In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve.  As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.

The restrictions on advertising, marketing and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on Canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, and our investment in Canopy. Canopy's business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both Canopy's compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance.  These include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and the NYSE.  These rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for Canopy.  Canopy is currently exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements because it is a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE and registered with the SEC and is subject to Canadian requirements.  When Canopy registered with the SEC, it did not need to test its internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""SOX"") that require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of Canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report as to the effectiveness of such controls.  The future application of SOX to Canopy will require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of Canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls.  Canopy has disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.  Canopy may not be able to remediate the material weakness timely.  Also, Canopy's internal controls may not be adequate, or Canopy may not be able to maintain adequate internal controls as required by SOX.  Canopy may not be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time.  If Canopy does not satisfy SOX requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm Canopy's business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of Canopy securities.",0.46581599,23.0521369444444,31,0.78181761

Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. In addition, recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions. We procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes, tariffs, or sanctions. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume, reduced margins, and profitability. We have experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases.

The Company also is the majority owner of COOCSA, a manufacturing entity in Mexico, and has established operations in Serbia and the U.K. PCT, located in the PRC, is currently a supplier of TBR tires for the Company and the Company entered into an off-take agreement with Sailun Vietnam, located in Vietnam, for the supply of TBR tires. Additionally, the Company recently announced a joint venture between Cooper Vietnam and Sailun Vietnam, which is expected to begin producing tires in 2020.  There are a number of risks in doing business abroad, including political and economic uncertainty, social unrest, sudden changes in laws and regulations, ability to enforce existing or future contracts, shortages of trained labor and the uncertainties associated with entering into joint ventures or similar arrangements in foreign countries. These risks may impact the Company's ability to expand its operations in different regions and otherwise achieve its objectives relating to its foreign operations, including utilizing these locations as suppliers to other markets. In addition, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, import and export limitations and exchange controls is burdensome and expensive. For example, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and, in some cases, other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining another improper benefit. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of the Company's business and on its ability to offer products and services in one or more countries, and could also harm the Company's reputation, business and results of operations. The Company's foreign operations also subject it to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities and to foreign currency risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the repatriation of funds.

Additionally, continuation or acceleration of price discounting, in Ontario, Québec, Alberta or other provinces, as well as increases in our cost of goods sold, could adversely impact our business. Further, changes in the Canadian tax legislation, such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes, could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover, the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends, in part, on our ability to efficiently conduct our operations.

In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terror attacks and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity, including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our assets, which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example, as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network, certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years, and we have and continue to incur brewery closure costs. We regularly review our supply chain network to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Such reviews could potentially result in further closures and the related costs could be material. Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business, liquidity and our financial results.    Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans' assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, court rulings or other changes in legal requirements, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and depending upon the other factors as listed above, we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash.

These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently, if we are not allowed, or are unable under acceptable terms or at all, to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.    Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed, it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the U.S. market, there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system, consisting of required separation of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further, in Canada, our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, we rely on our joint venture arrangements, such as BRI and BDL, to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets, known as The Beer Store, in Ontario, and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western Canadian provinces.

Because our financial statements are presented in USD, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally, we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities, such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures, as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further, certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements, which may affect our operations, including if our hedging arrangements do not",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"The vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2018 came from the U.K., which is our largest market in Europe. In 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union and the U.K. intends to withdraw from the European Union in March 2019. The withdrawal remains controversial in the U.K., and the terms of the withdrawal remain unknown. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Any significant weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Furthermore, the withdrawal may result in disruption to and decline of the U.K. and European economies. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. The withdrawal may also result in significant disruption in trade and the movement of goods, including prolonged transportation delays, which could negatively affect our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products. Because the terms of the exit are still unknown, we face regulatory and market uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility, including potential increased legal and regulatory complexities and potential higher costs of conducting business in the U.K. or Europe. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our European business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today, we may incur unexpected losses.    Along with other brewers in Canada, we currently use an industry standard returnable bottle which represents approximately 29% of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle, our current bottle inventory and a portion of our bottle packaging equipment could become obsolete and could result in a material write-off of these assets.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"An inability to expand our operations in emerging markets could adversely affect our growth prospects.    The continued expansion of our International segment in emerging markets depends on our ability to react to social, economic, and political conditions in those markets; to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets; and, in many cases, to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price, local regulatory changes, local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do, and cultural differences, or absence of effective routes to market, there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets, our growth prospects could be adversely affected. Our debt level, which increased significantly to fund the Acquisition, subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions. Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and operating covenants, including restrictions on priority indebtedness, leverage thresholds, liens, certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings, may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could, among other things: A deterioration in our credit rating could increase our borrowing rates or have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing or refinance current debt.    Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. A credit ratings downgrade could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally, in conjunction with the brand impairment tests, we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible, as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the results of our annual impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2016, indicated that the fair value of the Molson core brand indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, during this review, we also reassessed the asset's indefinite-life classification and determined that the Molson core brands have characteristics that have evolved which now indicate a definite-life is more appropriate. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets and are being amortized over useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years. Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal or regulatory proceedings related to our business. Such proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of such proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation, arbitration, regulatory or other proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management's outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

The inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles, glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes in various supply chain standards or agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business includes various joint venture and industry agreements which standardize parts of the supply chain system. An example includes our warehousing and customer delivery systems in Canada organized under joint venture agreements with other brewers. Any negative change in these agreements or material terms within these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"Our operations in developing and emerging markets expose us to additional risks which could harm our business and financial results.    We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally, including in connection with our acquisition of the Miller International Business. In certain of these markets, we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks, including: changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences. A breach of our information systems could cause material financial or reputational harm. Our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of cyber-attacks or other breaches to our security, which, if successful, could expose us to the loss of key business, employee, customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely prepare, distribute, invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or damage our reputation and credibility. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

We have entered into several joint ventures, including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container), and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company), for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Economic trends and intense competition in European markets could unfavorably affect our profitability.    Our European businesses have been, and, in the future may be, adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions, as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we face intense competition in certain of our European markets, particularly with respect to pricing, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular, the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) for the industry in general. Sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers, and, as a result, continuation or acceleration of this trend would further adversely affect our profitability.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions, we could experience a disruption to our business.    We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, obsolescence, or security breaches. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to us or favored by other stockholders or a majority of our board of directors.    Pentland Securities (1981) Inc.

24545,"Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Our business is highly regulated by national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs, licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters, ingredient regulations, and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation, varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""2017 Tax Act""), was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations. Most notably, the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and, as a result, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit of approximately $567 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017. We continue to monitor the 2017 Tax Act, including proposed regulations which may change upon finalization, as well as yet to be issued regulations and interpretations. If the forthcoming regulations and interpretations change relative to our current understanding and initial assessment of the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, the resulting impacts could have a material adverse impact on our tax rate and cash tax expectations. Separately, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a regulation that impacts our ability to claim a refund of certain federal duties, taxes, and fees paid for beer sold between the U.S. and certain other countries effective in February 2019, and, as a result, future claims will no longer be accepted, and further, we may be unable to collect approximately $38 million in historically claimed, but not yet received, refunds, which would negatively impact our revenue. Additionally, modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or aluminum tariffs) could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in June, U.S. 2018 tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect, which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs, the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or in tax, environmental, excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    In many of our markets, our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than we do, and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate, aggressive marketing strategies, such as reduced pricing, brand positioning, and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies may lead to stronger or new competitors, loss of partner brands, negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further, consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value, as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively.  Additionally, due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies, an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets, as well as the need for increased capital investment, marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover, most of our major markets are mature, so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. For example, sales in the U.S. and Canada accounted for approximately 80% of our total 2018 sales.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"Termination of one or more manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture, licensing, distribution, contract brewing or other similar arrangements, such as our agreement to import, market, distribute and sell Heineken in Canada and our arrangements to brew and distribute Beck's, Stella Artois, Lowenbrau and Spaten and to distribute Corona in Central Europe. Our inability to renew or the loss of one or more of these arrangements, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in 2017, our International segment was adversely impacted by the loss of the Modelo brands in Japan. Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.    We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials, some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties, to produce our products, including barley, malted barley, hops, corn, other various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum cans and bottles, glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers, as well as, cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices), trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, governmental regulations, including tariffs, frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, changes in precipitation patterns, the frequency of extreme weather events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, theft and industry surcharges and other practices. For example, in June 2018, U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and EU went into effect, which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers, our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval, which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part II-Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, ""Stockholders' Equity"" of the Notes for additional information regarding voting rights of Class A and Class B stockholders. Climate change, weather and water availability may negatively affect our business and financial results.    There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may impact quality, limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as hops, barley and other cereal grains, which are important ingredients for our products. Furthermore, should weather patterns in our markets shift from warm or high temperatures to unseasonably cool or wet weather, consumption of our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, distribution networks and routes to market, or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the cost and operational synergies of the Acquisition that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Weak, or weakening of, economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation, income taxes, the cost of living, unemployment levels, political or economic instability or other country-specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example, a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in the U.S. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth, in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products, particularly in the U.S., could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.    Our Coors Light and Miller Lite brands in the U.S., Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Coors Banquet and Carling brands in Canada, and Carling, Staropramen, Jelen, Bergenbier and Coors Light brands in Europe represented approximately half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2018. Additionally, several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market, therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to, among others, changing taste preferences, demographics, downturn in economic conditions or perceived value, as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity, regulatory actions or litigation. Recently, there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally, in some of our major markets, specifically Canada, the U.S. and Europe, there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to ""craft beer"" produced by smaller, regional microbreweries, as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover, several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets, therefore, small movements in consumer preference, such as consumer shifts away from premium light brands, can disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown, the emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer. As a result, a shift in consumer preferences away from our products or beer or a decline in the consumption of our products could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222
24545,"The success of our business relies heavily on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property.    It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality, even when unsubstantiated, could be harmful to our image and reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place, in the event we experienced an issue with product quality, we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition, because our brands carry family names, personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further, our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets and know-how. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada, Europe, and the U.S., we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.    As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50%, 35%, and 30% of our Canadian, European and U.S. workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike, work stoppage or other employee-related issue, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, our Toronto brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017.  From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation, and, if we are unable to timely complete negotiations, affected employees may strike, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.",0.31891418,22.9244872222222,31,-0.623273262222222

Our services include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements.  The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length. Currently those include: the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation (or impairment) of our deferred tax assets; and the valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time. As actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process.     We lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate.

CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. It also modifies the impairment model for debt securities AFS and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The impact of CECL will be dependent on the portfolio composition, credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption. For further information regarding new or updated standards, see Note 2, ""New Accounting Standards"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

From time to time, the regulators implement changes to those regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the Basel Committee on banking supervision and implemented by the FRB, when fully phased in, will likely require FNB to satisfy additional, more stringent and complex capital adequacy standards (see discussion under Business  -  Government Supervision and Regulation  -  caption ""Basel III Capital Rules""). Changes to present capital and liquidity requirements could restrict our activities and require us to maintain additional capital.

The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.  We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).  We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred.

37996,"Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.  Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer's or dealer's failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit's business.  The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.  Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction.  Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions, marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles.  Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values.  Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit's profitability if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit's projections.  See ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Item 7 for additional discussion. Increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more stringent enforcement programs, requests for field actions, and/or delays in regulatory approvals.  The cost to comply with existing government regulations is substantial and additional regulations or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.  The protocols could change aggressively, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales.

As in the U.S., regulatory and legislative actions outside the U.S. have been augmented substantially and made more complex, by measures such as the EU's Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and MiFID II. Further, ongoing changes in the EU's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to Brexit and any other changes in the composition of the EU's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations. Moreover, the adoption of new laws, regulations or standards and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations or standards have directly affected, and will continue to affect, our business. With new laws and changes in interpretation of existing requirements, the associated time we must dedicate to and related costs we must incur in meeting the regulatory complexities of our business have increased. We may be required to invest significant additional management time and resources to address new regulations being adopted pursuant to MiFID II and other laws. For example, MiFID II requires the ""unbundling"" of research and execution charges for trading.

In addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. We may perform services directly or through third parties.

Through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to investors globally. In order to be competitive and comply with our agreements, we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities, including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Many of our operations are complex and dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions effectively, which may occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although we expend considerable resources on internal controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate applicable guidelines, rules and regulations or adversely affect our clients, counterparties or us, our operations are ultimately dependent on our employees, as well as others involved in our business, such as third-party vendors, providers and other intermediaries, and subject to potential human errors. Our employees and others involved in our business may, from time to time, make mistakes that are not always immediately detected, which may disrupt our operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or sanctions, litigation, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, any misrepresentation of our services and products in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications could also adversely affect our reputation and business prospects. Our investment management fees, which represent the majority of our revenues, are dependent on fees earned under investment management agreements that we have with our products and clients. Our revenues could be adversely affected if such agreements representing a significant portion of our AUM are terminated. Further, certain of our subsidiaries may act as general partner for various investment partnerships, which may subject them to liability for the partnerships' liabilities.

38777,"A shift in our asset mix toward lower fee products may negatively impact our revenues. Changing market conditions and investor preferences may cause a shift in our asset mix toward certain lower fee products, such as fixed income products, and away from equity and multi-asset/balanced products. This may cause a related decline in our revenues and income, as we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from our equity and certain multi-asset/balanced products than from our fixed income products. Increases in interest rates, in particular if rapid, as well as any uncertainty in the future direction of interest rates, may have a negative impact on our fixed income products. Although the shorter duration of the bond investments in many of these products may help mitigate the interest rate risk, rising interest rates or interest rate uncertainty typically decrease the total return on many bond investments due to lower market valuations of existing bonds. Further, changing market conditions and investor preferences also may cause a shift in our asset mix toward lower fee exchange-traded funds. Moreover, we generally derive higher investment management and distribution fees from our international products than from our U.S. products, and higher sales fees from our U.S. products than from our international products. Changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix between international and U.S. assets, potentially resulting in a decline in our revenues and income depending upon the nature of our AUM and the level of management fees we earn on that AUM.",0.051451258,23.0644931111111,52,3.10289148888889

The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. There can be no assurance, however, that the framework - including its design and implementation - will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation. The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage.

Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, governmental scrutiny of the financial services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered.

We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations - for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.",0.2200682,22.7754107777778,52,-3.49087455
40729,"We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported. Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows. We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results.

Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary's performance, or investments in a subsidiary's own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally's subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally's right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC). The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB has recently increased this benchmark rate. In addition, the FRB has begun to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet, which is expected to exert upward pressure on interest rates as well and which also may create market volatility in interest rates.

54381,"On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Reform"") was signed into law. One of the major provisions in this legislation was a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. While this rate reduction was favorable to earnings in 2018, the rate change also required a revaluation of our existing net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.

We believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that Kroger's contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years.  A significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the Company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably, or adjust their current views unfavorably, when determining their ratings on our debt securities.  Any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital.

59255,"The global market in which we operate our Chemicals Segment is concentrated with the top six TiO2 producers accounting for approximately 58% of the world's production capacity and is highly competitive.  Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service.  Some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products if their costs are lower than our costs.  In addition, some of our competitors' financial, technological and other resources may be greater than our resources and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions.  Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.  Further, consolidation of our competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for our products or make it more difficult for us to compete with our competitors.  The occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses. Our Chemicals Segment has long-term supply contracts that provide for our TiO2 feedstock requirements that currently expire through 2020.  While we believe we will be able to renew these contracts, there can be no assurance we will be successful in renewing them or in obtaining long-term extensions to them prior to expiration. Our current agreements (including those entered into through January 2019) require us to purchase certain minimum quantities of feedstock with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $594 million in years subsequent to December 31, 2018.  In addition, we have other long-term supply and service contracts that provide for various raw materials and services. These agreements require us to purchase certain minimum quantities or services with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $156 million at December 31, 2018.

Historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand.  Relative changes in the selling prices for our products are one of the main factors that affect the level of our profitability.  In periods of increasing demand, our selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase, while in periods of decreasing demand our selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease.  In addition, pricing may affect customer inventory levels as customers may from time to time accelerate purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price increases or defer purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price decreases.  Our ability to further increase capacity without additional investment in greenfield or brownfield capacity increases may be limited and as a result, our profitability may become even more dependent upon the selling prices of our products.",0.29539415,19.7983745555556,32,4.5746852
59478,"Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. In the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents which applies to our biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other human pharmaceutical patents. As a result, we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings, and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the USPTO without the protections of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Our patents may be invalidated via this review process. Although such a decision can be appealed to the courts, in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market, while a win provides no precedential value - the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales.

Downward changes in the general economy, the housing market or other business conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The housing market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, access to labor, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in any of the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and could adversely impact our businesses by: causing consumers to delay or decrease homeownership; making consumers more price conscious resulting in a shift in demand to smaller homes; making consumers more reluctant to make investments in their existing homes; or making it more difficult to secure loans for major renovations or new home construction.

Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture and/or distribute as well as for delivery of our raw materials. In particular, a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, which are highly regulated. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability. We have a high degree of product concentration in OSB.

Concentration of our business in the OSB market further increases our sensitivity to commodity pricing and price volatility. Historical prices for our commodity products have been volatile, and we, like other participants in the building products industry, have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products. Commodity product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the building products industry. Product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity. Demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of other factors, including the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity, changes in the availability and cost of mortgage financing. In this competitive environment with so many variables for which we do not control, we cannot assure you that pricing for OSB will not decline from current levels.",0.21362399,21.7005871111111,32,-3.71084681444444

We have incurred, and may continue to incur, indebtedness in furtherance of our activities. Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, our Board of Directors may authorize us to incur additional debt. We could therefore become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to shareholders. Future terrorist attacks and military conflicts could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions, consumer confidence and market liquidity. Among other things, it is possible that interest rates may be affected by these events. An increase in interest rates may increase our costs of borrowing, leading to a reduction in our earnings. Terrorist acts could also result in significant damages to, or loss of, our properties. We and our tenants may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable economic terms for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Our lenders may require that we carry terrorism insurance even if we do not believe this insurance is necessary or cost effective. We may also be prohibited under the applicable lease from passing all or a portion of the cost of such insurance through to the tenant. Should an act of terrorism result in an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property. Any loss of these types could adversely affect our financial condition.",0.44869193,20.9589282222222,53,-4.33284372666667

67887,"The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles, domestic and foreign governmental tariff, trade and monetary policies, and economic conditions and events. For example, our defense programs are largely contingent on U.S. Department of Defense funding. In addition, our space programs rely on the same governmental funding as well as investment for commercial and exploration activities. Our aerospace programs are dependent on the highly cyclical commercial airline industry, driven by fuel price increases, demand for travel and economic conditions. Demand for our industrial products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth, the price of oil and natural gas, cost-reduction efforts and technology upgrades. If global economic uncertainties continue or economic conditions deteriorate, our operations could be negatively impacted through declines in our sales, profitability and cash flows due to lower orders, payment delays and price pressures for our products. We make estimates in accounting for over-time contracts, and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings. We have over-time contracts with some of our customers. These contracts are predominantly within Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls. Revenue representing 64% of 2019 sales was accounted for using an input method that uses costs incurred to measure progress toward completion (""cost-to-cost""). Under this method, we recognize revenue as work progresses toward completion as determined by the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. Changes in these required estimates could have a material adverse effect on sales and profits. Any adjustments are recognized in the period in which the change becomes known using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. For contracts with anticipated losses at completion, we establish a provision for the entire amount of the estimated remaining loss and charge it against income in the period in which the loss becomes known and can be reasonably estimated. Amounts representing performance incentives, penalties, contract claims or impacts of scope change negotiations are considered in estimating revenues, costs and profits when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Due to the substantial judgments involved with this process, our actual results could differ materially or could be settled unfavorably from our estimates.",0.26755607,20.1467803888889,33,-0.34383626
67887,"Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property is critical in order to maintain a competitive advantage. We therefore rely on internally developed and acquired patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge and technologies. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert management's focus away from operations. We depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs. Sales to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. In 2019, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented 35% of our total sales, primarily within Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls. Sales to foreign governments represented 7% of our total sales. Funding for government programs can be structured into a series of individual contracts and depend on annual congressional appropriations, which are cyclical. At times when there are perceived threats to national security, U.S. Defense spending can increase; at other times, defense spending can decrease. Future levels of defense spending beyond 2019 are uncertain and subject to congressional debate. Any reduction in future Department of Defense spending levels could adversely impact our sales, operating profit and our cash flow. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts are rescheduled or terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources. We are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which may be unfavorable to us. Our business may be adversely impacted by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. We estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable given the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingencies recorded as liabilities.",0.26755607,20.1467803888889,33,-0.34383626
67887,"Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company and third parties to administer, store and support multiple business activities. In addition, we store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee data on our servers and databases. Furthermore, we may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal information that may be subject to privacy and security laws and controls. Although we continue to review and enhance our computer systems and cybersecurity controls, information system disruptions, equipment failures or cybersecurity attacks, such as unauthorized access, malicious software and other intrusions, could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption and exposure of proprietary and confidential information. Any intrusion may cause operational stoppages, fines, penalties, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to comply with our customers', including the U.S. Government's, increased cybersecurity protections and standards in our products. Prior cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. In addition, we have embarked on a multi-year business information system transformation and standardization project. This endeavor will occupy additional resources, diverting attention from other operational activities, may cause our information systems to perform unexpectedly and may increase our exposure to cyber risks. While we expect to invest significant resources throughout the planning and project management process, unanticipated delays could occur and would adversely affect our financial results. Unforeseen exposure to additional income tax liabilities may affect our operating results. Our distribution of taxable income is subject to domestic and, as a result of our significant manufacturing and sales presence in foreign countries, foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate and earnings may be affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and outcomes of any audits performed on previous tax returns. Additionally, any alterations to tax regulations or interpretations could have significant impacts on our effective tax rates and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.",0.26755607,20.1467803888889,33,-0.34383626
67887,"Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. We have significant manufacturing and sales operations in foreign countries. In addition, our domestic operations sell to foreign customers. In 2019, 39% of our net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations including privacy laws protecting personal data, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements. In addition, any local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any other terrorist activities could adversely affect customer demand, our operations and our ability to source and deliver products and services to our customers. Significant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements. Pension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Despite fully funding our largest pension plan, changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our earnings, equity and funding requirements. Our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility. We have incurred significant indebtedness, and may incur additional debt for acquisitions, operations, research and development and capital expenditures. Our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and operate within the restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. These changes could increase our cost of business, limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.",0.26755607,20.1467803888889,33,-0.34383626
67887,"We may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenue, which could adversely affect our future revenue and growth prospects. As of September 28, 2019, our total backlog was $2.2 billion, which represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue. There is no assurance that our customers will purchase all the orders represented in our backlog, due in part to governments' abilities to modify, curtail or terminate major programs. Due to the uncertain nature of our contracts with the U.S. Government and other foreign governments, we may never realize revenue from some of the orders that are included in our backlog. A portion of our backlog also relates to commercial aircraft programs as well as industrial programs. If there are aircraft entry into service delays, lower than anticipated aircraft deliveries due to production issues or overall weakening economic outlooks, we may never realize the full amounts included in our backlog. If this occurs, our future revenue and growth prospects may be adversely affected. Our sales and earnings may be affected if we cannot identify, acquire or integrate strategic acquisitions, or if we engage in divesting activities. Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy. Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend, in part, on our ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquired businesses. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. Growth by acquisition involves risk that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We may not know the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities. Additionally, the expected benefits or synergies might not be fully realized, integrating operations and personnel may be slowed and key employees, suppliers or customers of the acquired business may depart. We may also continue to engage in divesting activities if we deem the operations as non-strategic or underperforming. Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of a transaction. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, integrating acquired businesses, or divesting business operations, management's time and attention may be diverted from our core business, while consuming resources and incurring expenses for these activities.",0.26755607,20.1467803888889,33,-0.34383626
67887,"If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. We rely on subcontracts with other companies to perform portions of the service we provide to our customers on many of our contracts. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract or our hiring of personnel of a subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon, defect-free supplies, or perform the agreed-upon services, may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay or failure in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations to our customers. Our operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs. Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations, future changes in these laws,   regulations or interpretations of them, or changes in the nature of our operations may require us to make significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance. We have been and are currently involved in environmental remediation activities.

We must continuously improve product development and manufacturing processes and systems to ensure we deliver high-quality, technically advanced products. Due to growth in operations, there is a risk our current manufacturing processes and systems are unable to maintain our high-quality and on-time delivery standards for our customers. If we are unable to maintain these standards, we could experience late deliveries and penalties, recalls, increased warranty costs, order cancellations and litigation. Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business. Terror attacks, war or other civil disturbances, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could lead to economic instability and decreased demand for commercial products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, terrorist attacks worldwide have caused instability in global financial markets and the aviation industry. In 2019, 24% of our net sales were in the commercial aircraft market. Also, our facilities and suppliers are located throughout the world and could be subject to damage from fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters. Although we carry third party property insurance covering these and other risks, our inability to meet customers' schedules as a result of a catastrophe may result in the loss of customers or significantly increase costs, including penalty claims under customer contracts. We operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess. Many of our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors, especially in our industrial markets and medical markets, are larger, more diversified and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. Within the aerospace industry, suppliers have consolidated to widen their product offerings and secure long-term sole-source positions.

Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, environmental protection and taxation. Our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water. In the event of environmental violations or other environmental, health or safety impacts, we may be charged with remedial costs and land owners may file claims for alternative water supplies, property damage or bodily injury. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may, in some circumstances, result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault. No assurance can be given that continued compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment of production or processing activities or result in a material increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing operations.

As discussed in the footnote titled Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we are the subject of a recently filed lawsuit relating to our two remaining affiliated partnerships and are currently involved in a fiduciary duty lawsuit regarding our environmental compliance programs. The outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management attention and other factors. In addition, the resolution of such a proceeding could result in penalties or sanctions, settlement costs and/or judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

As a result of these strategic alliances, the success of Tommy Hilfiger's North American men's wholesale business and its licensed women's wholesale business with G-III were substantially dependent on these relationships and on the ability of Macy's to maintain and increase sales of TOMMY HILFIGER products. The exclusive arrangements are both being terminated effective for the Spring 2019 selling season. We cannot assure you that Macy's will continue to order the same volume of TOMMY HILFIGER products from us or our licensees or that other department stores will purchase TOMMY HILFIGER products in sufficient volume to offset any reduction in sales to Macy's.

For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that will, effective January 1, 2020, substantially change the accounting for credit losses and other financial assets held by banks, financial  institutions and other organizations. The standard removes the existing ""probable"" threshold in generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address the upcoming change to the allowance measurement and subsequent concerns related to the impact on capital and capital planning. The rule provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital impact upon adoption of the standard. The impact of this final rule will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of the standard over a three-year period. The adoption of the standard may result in an overall material increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the impact at adoption will be influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. It is also possible that ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption. We have historically employed, as important parts of our business strategy, growth through acquisition of banks and, to a lesser extent, through branch acquisitions and de novo branching. Any future acquisitions in which we might engage will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions.

Further, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and de novo branching. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business and growth strategy and maintain or increase our market value and profitability.

We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (better known as ""Proposition 65"") requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the State of California that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products, as well as civil penalties. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. In particular, we are currently a defendant in Council for Education and Research on Toxics (""Plaintiff"" or ""CERT"") v. Brad Barry LLC, et al., which alleges that we, in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture, package, distribute, or sell packaged coffee, failed to warn persons in California that our coffee products expose persons to the chemical acrylamide, which is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (measured in parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process, in violation of Proposition 65. If we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of Proposition 65, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted, and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.",0.35370076,23.2375815555556,31,0.610446509111111

We believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors, such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner, if the Company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity, if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience, or if our products become unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior products, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products. If our brand values are diminished, our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, anything that harms the Dunkin' Donuts or Rachael Ray brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands. In particular, we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and, therefore, essential to our coffee brands. Because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents, it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known. We also believe that our packaging innovations, such as our AromaSeal™ canisters, are important to the coffee business' marketing and operational efforts. If our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods, the value of our coffee brands may be diminished, and we could lose customers to our competitors.",0.35370076,23.2375815555556,31,0.610446509111111

This dependency is exacerbated in the current ""FinTech"" environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (""Blockchain""), and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. For example, in 2018, we acquired Charles River Development, and we are leveraging the capabilities we acquired in that transaction to create an interoperable front-to-back office servicing platform combining the offerings within our Investment Servicing business line. The introduction of new products and services can require significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals and the development and implementation of technical, control and model validation requirements. New products and services, such as an interoperable front-to-back office servicing platform, often also involve dependencies on third parties to, among other things, access innovative technologies, develop new distribution channels or form collaborative product and service offerings, and can require complex strategic alliances and joint venture relationships.   Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services,  strategic alliances and joint ventures including rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices, the sharing of benefits in those relationships, conflicts with existing business partners and clients and sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and are compliant with applicable regulations. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities.

In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses. We expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities.  For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.  We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.  The success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. We also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses.

The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Senior Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes.

A reduction in sales to any of our major customers in this market could negatively impact our business.  A reduction in demand could result from numerous causes including a reduction in overall market demand for heavy mobile equipment, in-sourcing of engineered cabs by our customers, or increased competition. An increase in the spread between the price of steel and steel scrap prices can have a negative impact on our margins.  No matter how efficient, our operations which use steel as a raw material, create some amount of scrap.  The expected price of scrap compared to the price of the steel raw material is generally factored into pricing.

We have wholly-owned facilities in Austria, Poland, Portugal and Turkey and joint venture facilities in Canada, China, France, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom, and are active in exploring other foreign opportunities.  The risks of doing business in foreign countries include, among other factors: the potential for adverse changes in the local political climate, in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the United States or in government policies, laws or regulations; terrorist activity that may cause social disruption; logistical and communications challenges; costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations; difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; deterioration of foreign economic conditions; inflation and fluctuations in interest rates; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; foreign exchange restrictions; differing local business practices and cultural considerations; restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply, including energy and raw materials; changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or other protectionist measures; and potential issues related to matters covered by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regulations related to import/export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program, anti-boycott provisions or similar laws.

Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, we believe that our ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters should not be material to our business or financial condition. On a consolidated basis our financial results are approximately equally weighted across our quarters, however, sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal. Further discussion over the seasonality of our sales is included under the caption Seasonality under Item 1 above. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. In addition, orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. If we are unable to accurately forecast and prepare for customer orders or our working capital needs, or there is a general downturn in business or economic conditions during these periods, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the majority of the federal and state deferred tax assets will create tax benefits in the future. As a consequence of earlier business combinations and issuances of common stock, the Company and its subsidiaries have had various changes of ownership that continue to subject a significant amount of the Company's U.S. NOLs and other tax attributes to certain limitations; and therefore a valuation allowance is still recognized on certain federal and state tax asset carryforwards that are expected to expire due to the ownership change limitations or because we do not believe we will earn enough taxable income to utilize. Changes to state conformity to the provisions of the Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on the valuation allowance recorded on U.S. state net operating losses.

109177,"We continue to engage in targeted restructuring initiatives to align our business operations in response to current and anticipated future market conditions and investment strategy. We will evaluate opportunities for additional initiatives to restructure or reorganize the business across our operating segments and functions with a focus on areas of strategic growth and optimizing operational efficiency. Significant risks associated with these actions may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated cost reduction or may disrupt our business including delays in shipping, implementation of workforce, redundant costs, and failure to meet operational targets. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Refer to Note 5 - Restructuring and Related Charges in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional detail over restructuring related activity. The steps required by GAAP entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity. Events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that there may be an impairment and which may indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary include, but are not limited to: strategic decisions to exit a business or dispose of an asset made in response to changes in economic, political and competitive conditions; the impact of the economic environment on the customer base and on broad market conditions that drive valuation considerations by market participants; our internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions we make when performing impairment reviews; a significant decrease in the market price of our assets; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are used; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect our assets; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset; and significant changes in the cash flows associated with an asset. As a result of such circumstances, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

109177,"In the ordinary course of our business, the Company may be named as a defendant in lawsuits involving product liability claims. In any such proceedings, plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts of damages, and the matters may remain unresolved for several years. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlement related to these matters. The Company sells perishable treats for animal consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. The Company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, the Company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. For example, on June 10, 2017, the Company initiated a voluntary safety recall of various rawhide chew products for dogs sold by the Company's GPC segment due to possible chemical contamination. The costs of the recall negatively impacted Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA in the GPC segment in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2018. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the Company's sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that Company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the Company's reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image. Although we have product liability insurance coverage and an excess umbrella policy, our insurance policies may not provide coverage for certain, or any, claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future.

276720,"Our water sales for the past two years have been highly concentrated among companies providing fracking services to the oil and gas industry, and         such sales can fluctuate significantly. Our water sales have been historically highly concentrated directly and indirectly with one to three companies providing fracking services to the oil and gas       industry on and around the Lowry Range and our Sky Ranch property. Generally, investment in oil and gas development is dependent on the price of oil and gas. While water sales for fracking represented 90% and 89% of our total water revenues during       the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we have no long-term contractual commitments that will ensure these sales in the future.  The oil and gas industry has periodically gone through periods when activity has significantly       declined. For example, water sales for fracking represented less than 1% of our total water revenues during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. Our land development segment may be subject to risks related to oil and gas operations in the vicinity of our Sky Ranch development, which could have         an adverse impact on the marketability and/or value of our Sky Ranch property.  We have leased the minerals underlying Sky Ranch to a wholly owned subsidiary of a major independent exploration and       production company. Oil and gas extraction is an inherently dangerous activity that can potentially lead to air and water contamination, fire, explosion or other hazards. While the State of Colorado, local governments, and private operators have       regulations and procedures in place intended to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurances that these safeguards will be effective in all cases with respect to any oil and gas activity around Sky Ranch.  The existence of oil and gas wells and       drilling activity in or near our property and public concern regarding the negative health impacts from emissions near drilling and hydraulic fracturing sites, including those detailed in a recent 380-page report submitted to the Colorado Department       of Public Health and Environment entitled the Final Report: Human Health Risk Assessment for Oil & Gas Operations in Colorado dated October 17, 2019, may adversely impact the marketability and/or value       of the lots at Sky Ranch and decrease demand for homes in proximity to oil and gas operations, negatively impacting our land development segment, which could also negatively impact our business and financial condition.",0.0,19.3935047777778,22,-1.97011533933333
276720,"The rates that the Rangeview District is allowed to charge customers on the Lowry Range for water services are limited by the Lease with the Land         Board and our contract with the Rangeview District and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation. The prices charged by the         Rangeview District for water service on the Lowry Range are subject to pricing regulations set forth in the Lease with the Land Board. Both the tap fees and usage rates and charges are capped at the average of the rates of three nearby water         providers. Annually, the Rangeview District surveys the tap fees and rates of the three nearby providers, and the Rangeview District may adjust tap fees and rates and charges for water service on the Lowry Range based on the average of those         charged by this group. We receive 100% of tap fees and 98% of water usage fees charged by the Rangeview District to its customers after the deduction of royalties owed to the Land Board. Our costs associated with the construction of water systems         and the production, treatment and delivery of water are subject to market conditions and other factors, which may increase at a significantly higher rate than that of the fees we receive from the Rangeview District. Factors beyond our control and         which cannot be predicted, such as government regulations, insurance and labor markets, drought, water contamination and severe weather conditions, like tornadoes and floods, may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be         recoverable under the current rate structure. Both increased customer demand and increased water conservation may also impact the overall cost of our operations. If the costs for construction and operation of         our wholesale water services, including the cost of extracting our groundwater, exceed our revenues, we would be providing water service to the Rangeview District for use at the Lowry Range at a loss.

As a result, the Company may be required to write-down the book value of its Sky Ranch or other land interests in accordance with accounting       principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and some of those write-downs could be material. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of       operations. The Company assesses its land interests when indicators of impairment exist. Indicators of impairment include a decrease in demand for housing due to soft market conditions; competitive pricing pressures that reduce the average sales       price of finished lots; sales absorption rates below management expectations; a decrease in the value of homes or the underlying land due to general market conditions, actual or perceived risks due to proximity to oil and gas drilling operations, or       other reasons; and a decrease in projected cash flows for a project.

To arrive at a finding of reasonable diligence, the water       court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of said water rights. If the water court is unable to make such a finding, we could lose the water right under review. During each of fiscal 2012 and 2018, the Lowry Range       conditional decrees were granted review by the water court, which determined that we and the Rangeview District met the diligence criteria. The water court entered a finding of reasonable diligence on the Lowry Range surface water decrees in January       2019. Our next review for reasonable diligence on the Lowry Range surface water decrees will be in January 2025.

While we have generated net income in the past two fiscal years, we have a long history of losses. Our cash flows from operations generally have not been sufficient         to fund our operations, and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital and sell assets to remain in operation. Since 2004, we have raised $76.3 million through (i) the issuance of $25.3 million of common stock (including the issuance of         stock pursuant to the exercise of options, net of expenses), (ii) the issuance of $5.2 million of convertible debt, which was converted to common stock on January 11, 2011, and (iii) the sale of our Arkansas         River water and land for approximately $45.8 million in cash. Our continuing development of the first phase of Sky Ranch requires significant cash expenditures. We have advanced the CAB approximately $20 million for construction of public       improvements on the Sky Ranch property. The CAB is not required to repay us for advances made or expenses incurred for improvements at Sky Ranch unless and until the CAB and/or Sky Ranch Districts issue bonds in an amount sufficient to reimburse us       for all or a portion of advances made or expenses incurred. We have funded and expect to continue to fund such expenditures with cash on hand and cash flows from operations. At August 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.7 million of cash and marketable securities on hand, which is a significant decrease compared to our fiscal 2018 balance. We currently have a limited number of customers. If our cash on hand and future cash flows         from operations are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water and wastewater systems and develop Sky Ranch, we may be forced to seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital.

Continued growth of the Company's business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company's currently marketed products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. As noted above in Healthcare Environment, pricing pressure in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs, including implementing healthcare reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, where available. In addition, the Company anticipates that the reported inquiries made by various governmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in China may continue. For example, in 2018, sales of Zepatier were materially unfavorably affected by increasing competition and declining patient volumes. Sales of Zostavax were also materially unfavorably affected due to competition.

Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.",0.50967222,25.5141398888889,32,0.319626944444444

In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure ""first-to-market"" or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California.

There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments.

Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening patients for our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval.

Our assets under management, which affect revenue, are subject to significant fluctuations. Our major sources of revenue, including investment advisory, administrative, distribution and service fees, are generally calculated as percentages of assets under management. Fee rates for our investment strategies and services generally vary by investment mandate (e.g., equity, fixed income, floating-rate income, alternative, portfolio implementation or exposure management services) and investment vehicle (e.g., fund or separate account). An adverse change in asset mix by mandate or vehicle, independent of our level of assets under management, may result in a decrease in our overall average effective fee rate. Any decrease in the level of our assets under management generally would reduce our revenue and net income. Assets under management could decrease due to, among other things, a decline in securities prices, a decline in the sales of our investment offerings, an increase in open-end fund redemptions or client withdrawals, repurchases of, or other reductions in, closed-end fund shares outstanding, or reductions in leverage used by investment vehicles. Adverse market conditions and/or lack of investor confidence in the financial markets could lead to a decrease in investor risk tolerance. A decrease in investor risk tolerance could result in investors withdrawing from markets or decreasing their rate of investment, thereby reducing our overall assets under management and adversely affecting our revenue, earnings and growth prospects. Changes in investor risk tolerance could also result in investor allocation away from higher-fee strategies to lower-fee strategies, which could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.

It is uncertain how regulatory trends will be affected by current and future political developments. We could be adversely affected by counterparty or client defaults. As we have seen in periods of significant market volatility, the deteriorating financial condition of a single financial institution may materially and adversely affect the performance of others. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, have exposure to many different counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties across the financial industry. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client, or in the event of other unrelated systemic market failures. Our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination on short notice or non-renewal. We derive almost all of our revenue from management fees, distribution income and service fees received from managed funds and separate accounts. As a result, we are dependent upon management contracts, administrative contracts, distribution contracts, underwriting contracts and/or service contracts under which these fees are paid.

As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.",0.0,22.5772927777778,33,-0.726034876222222

We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.  Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates.  These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan and lease losses; the fair value of securities, acquired assets and liabilities, including the valuation of intangible assets; off-balance sheet financial instruments;  and the accounting for income taxes.  Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value, or significantly increase liabilities measured at fair value or our accrued tax liability.

Management performed an annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2018. Based on these analyses, management concluded that the fair value of the Company's reporting units exceeded the fair value of its assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired. It is possible that management's assumptions and conclusions regarding the valuation of the Company's lines of business could change adversely, which could result in the recognition of impairment for goodwill, which could have a material effect on the Company's financial position and future results of operations. Declines in the value of securities held in the investment portfolio may negatively affect the Company's earnings and capital. The value of an investment in the portfolio could decrease due to changes in market factors. The market value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary impairments could materially adversely affect the Company's future earnings and capital. Continued volatility in the market value of certain of the investment securities, whether caused by changes in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the value of the securities. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company's accumulated other comprehensive loss and shareholders' equity depending upon the direction of the fluctuations. The Company may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. In order to maintain capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, to replace existing capital, or to complete acquisitions the Company may be required to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock.

Hydraulic fracturing involves the high-pressure injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state proposed and enacted laws and regulations have emerged which could increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry - Environmental regulation - Hydraulic fracturing for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us with respect to hydraulic fracturing. Certain previously existing climate-related regulations, such as those related to the control of methane emissions, have been, or are in the process of being, reviewed, suspended, revised, or rescinded. See Part I, Item 1.

Undoing previously existing regulations has and likely will continue to involve lengthy notice-and-comment rulemaking, and the resulting decisions have been and likely will continue to be subject to litigation by opposition groups. Thus, the scope and impact of existing and potential future regulations remains substantially uncertain with respect to the implementation of climate-related public policies. However, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain possible, and certain states have separately imposed their own regulations on emissions from oil and gas production activities and other states may do so as well.",0.33924681,22.33206,21,1.14200158888889

From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. We do not currently own or operate infrastructure used to facilitate the transportation and exportation of crude oil; however, third party compliance with regulations that impact the transportation or exportation of our production may increase our costs of doing business and inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell our production, whether domestically or internationally, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.

See Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.

Rules and regulations have been developed in Oklahoma to address these concerns by limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations or increasing the cost of disposal. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. Regulators in some states, including states in which we operate, have imposed or are considering additional requirements related to seismicity. See Part I, Item 1.

The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases. In addition, if we fail to maintain appropriate levels of capital or liquidity, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions that may impose restrictions on our business, including limiting our lending activities or our ability to expand, requiring us to raise additional capital (which may be dilutive to shareholders) or requiring regulatory approval to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.",0.079605222,20.1508601111111,52,-0.915517947777778

In addition, we might be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following the year of disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would reduce significantly the cash flow available for distribution to shareholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to our shareholders as a condition to REIT qualification.

From time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (""ASU 2016-13""), that will, effective January 1, 2020, substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management's estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this upcoming change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances. The final rule provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard. The impact of this final rule on Citizens and CBNA will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of the standard over a three-year period.

Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor.

This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.

As discussed above in connection with the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the federal government has in the last couple of years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities. In the past few years, DOJ and HHS as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to ensure strict compliance with various reimbursement related regulations as well as combat healthcare fraud. DOJ has pursued and recovered record amounts based on alleged healthcare fraud. The increased enforcement efforts have frequently included aggressive arguments and interpretations of laws and regulations that pose risks for all providers. For example, the federal government has increasingly asserted that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping may represent violations of the False Claims Act. Human error and oversight in record keeping and documentation, particularly where those activities are the responsibility of non-employees, are always a risk in business, and healthcare providers and independent physicians are no different. Additionally, the federal government has been willing to challenge the medical judgment of independent physicians in determining issues such as the medical necessity of a given treatment plan.

The False Claims Act allows private citizens, called ""relators,"" to institute civil proceedings on behalf of the United States alleging violations of the False Claims Act. These lawsuits, also known as ""whistleblower"" or ""qui tam"" actions, can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys' fees and the award of bounties to the relators who successfully prosecute or bring these suits to the government. Qui tam cases are sealed at the time of filing, which means knowledge of the information contained in the complaint typically is limited to the relator, the federal government, and the presiding court.  The defendant in a qui tam action may remain unaware of the existence of a sealed complaint for years. While the complaint is under seal, the government reviews the merits of the case and may conduct a broad investigation and seek discovery from the defendant and other parties before deciding whether to intervene in the case and take the lead on litigating the claims. The court lifts the seal when the government makes its decision on whether to intervene. If the government decides not to intervene, the relator may elect to continue to pursue the lawsuit individually on behalf of the government.

In recent years, our inpatient rehabilitation segment has experienced a shift in payor mix to a slightly larger percentage of Medicaid patients. We could also experience a shift to a lower average patient acuity. Both of these shifts adversely affect pricing growth. See the ""Segment Results of Operations - Inpatient Rehabilitation - Net Operating Revenues"" section of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The expansion and growth of Medicaid resulting from provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws has increased the number of those patients coming to us. Medicaid reimbursement rates are almost always the lowest among those of our payors, and frequently Medicaid patients come to us with other complicating conditions that make treatment more difficult and costly.

However, US federal net operating losses generated in fiscal years 2018 and forward are not subject to expiration and net operating losses generated in fiscal 2019 and forward are only available to offset eighty percent of taxable income each year due to changes in tax law attributable to the passage of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We are also subject to various ongoing employment disputes outside of the collective bargaining agreements. We consider these to not be material, but any current or future dispute could become material. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements generally contain ""amendable dates"" rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, or the parties have been released to ""self-help"" by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as lockouts and strikes.

The Company's revenues from its television, cable networks and digital services businesses are partially dependent on the Company's continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Moreover, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive library of television programming. Generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication, however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened. If the content of its television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the Company's revenues could be adversely affected. The Company obtains a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. For example, some of CBS Television Network's most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf's Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship, NFL games, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament games and series such as Young Sheldon, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the Company has negotiated with third parties.  In addition, Showtime Networks enters into commitments and competes with other buyers to acquire rights to certain programming for Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix from motion picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations. The Company competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce programming. In addition, competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the Company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the Company.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, the conduct of our independent registered public accounting firm is overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (""PCAOB""). These and other regulators may make additional inquiries regarding, or change their application of, existing laws and regulations regarding our independent auditor, financial statements or other financial reports and the possibility of such additional inquiries or changes is increasing in frequency in connection with broader market reforms. These changes are difficult to predict, and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. It is possible that the changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (""PwC"") informed us that it has identified a potential issue related to its independence under Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the ""Loan Rule""). The Loan Rule prohibits accounting firms, such as PwC, from being deemed independent if they have certain financial relationships with their audit clients or certain affiliates of those clients. Pursuant to the SEC's application of the Loan Rule, PwC has advised us that certain relationships between PwC and its lenders who also are record owners of various funds in the Columbia Threadneedle Investments family of funds (collectively, the ""Columbia Threadneedle Investments Funds"") or certain other entities within the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. investment company complex, may implicate the Loan Rule. On June 20, 2016, the Staff of the SEC issued a ""no-action"" letter confirming that it would not recommend that the SEC commence enforcement action against an unrelated fund that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances. The SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter was temporary and would expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter and on September 22, 2017 the SEC subsequently issued a letter extending the no-action relief until the SEC amends the Loan Rule to address concerns expressed in the no-action letter. On May 2, 2018, the SEC proposed amendments to the Loan Rule, which, if adopted as proposed, would refocus the analysis that must be conducted to determine whether an audit firm is independent when the audit firm has a lending relationship with certain shareholders of an audit firm client at any time during an audit or professional engagement period. However, these amendments have not yet been finalized. If it was determined that PwC was not independent, or we do not receive some form of exemptive relief, among other things, the financial statements audited by PwC and the interim financial statements reviewed by PwC may have to be audited and reviewed, respectively, by another independent registered public accounting firm. PwC has advised us that, based on its knowledge and analyses of our facts and circumstances, it is not aware of any facts that would preclude reliance by us, our affiliates and other entities within the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. investment company complex on the no-action letter. PwC has also affirmed to us that they are able to exercise objective and impartial judgment in their audits of us, our affiliates and the Columbia Threadneedle Investments Funds, are independent accountants within the meaning of PCAOB Rule 3520 Auditor Independence and in their view can continue to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm. The Company has considered disclosures made to it by PwC of lending relationships described by PwC, PwC's representation that it is independent within the meaning of the PCAOB Rule 3520, and representations made to the Company's Audit Committee by PwC that PwC believes that a reasonable investor possessing all the facts regarding the lending relationships and audit relationships would conclude that PwC is able to exhibit the requisite objectivity and impartiality to report on the Company's financial statements as the independent registered public accounting firm.

Risk Factors As an example, with Brexit there is a significant degree of uncertainty about how negotiations relating to the UK's withdrawal and new trade agreements will be conducted, as well as the potential consequences and precise timeframe for withdrawal from the EU. While the UK invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the EU on March 30, 2019, the final terms and full impact remains uncertain. During this period and beyond, the impact of any partial or complete dissolution of the EU on the UK and European economies and the broader global economy could be significant, resulting in negative impacts on currency and financial markets generally, such as increased volatility and illiquidity, and potentially lower economic growth in markets in the UK, Europe and globally, which may adversely affect the value of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds' portfolio investments. The UK has one of the largest economies in Europe, and member countries of the EU are substantial trading partners of the UK. The UK financial service sector continues to face uncertainty over the final relationship with the EU and globally as a result of Brexit. For example, certain financial services operations may have to move outside of the UK after withdrawal from the EU (e.g., currency trading, international settlement operations). Additionally, depending on the final terms of Brexit, certain financial services business may be forced to move staff and comply with two separate sets of rules or lose business to firms in Europe. Furthermore, the final terms of Brexit may create the potential for decreased trade, the possibility of capital outflows, devaluation of the pound sterling, the cost of higher corporate bond spreads, and the risk that all the above could negatively impact business and consumer spending as well as foreign direct investment. As a result of Brexit, the British economy and its currency may be negatively impacted by changes to the UK's economic and political relations with the EU and other countries.

A ""new line of business"" includes any business that is not closely related to AB's historical business of providing research and diversified investment management and related services to its clients.

We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base ""C"" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.

831641,"prevent and deter fraud, misconduct, and non-compliance, we face the risk that our employees or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud, or other improper activities. U.S. government agencies, such as the DCAA, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These government agencies review and audit a government contractor's performance under its contracts and cost structure, and evaluate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. In addition, during the course of its audits, the DCAA may question our incurred project costs. If the DCAA believes we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements for FAR or CAS, the DCAA auditor may recommend to our U.S. government corporate administrative contracting officer that such costs be disallowed. Historically, we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of government audits. However, we can provide no assurance that the DCAA or other government audits will not result in material disallowances for incurred costs in the future. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to various other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance, and accounting for these contracts. We may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. For example, as discussed elsewhere in this report, on January 14, 2019, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office (""USAO"") filed complaints in intervention in three qui tam actions filed against our subsidiary, Tetra Tech EC, Inc. (""TtEC""), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints allege False Claims Act violations and breach of contract related to TtEC's contracts to perform environmental remediation services at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. TtEC disputes the claims and will defend this matter vigorously. U.S. government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit, and/or suspension of payment, any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible government contractor. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation. Any interruption or termination of our U.S. government contractor status could reduce our profits and revenue significantly.",0.12876967,22.2021302222222,54,-0.0988290783333333
831641,"U.S. government contracts are awarded through a regulated procurement process. The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multi-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions, such as indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (""IDIQ"") contracts, which generally require those contractors who have previously been awarded the IDIQ to engage in an additional competitive bidding process before a task order is issued. As a result, new work awards tend to be smaller and of shorter duration, since the orders represent individual tasks rather than large, programmatic assignments. In addition, we believe that there has been an increase in the award of federal contracts based on a low-price, technically acceptable criteria emphasizing price over qualitative factors, such as past performance. As a result, pricing pressure may reduce our profit margins on future federal contracts. The increased competition and pricing pressure, in turn, may require us to make sustained efforts to reduce costs in order to realize revenue, and profits under government contracts. If we are not successful in reducing the amount of costs we incur, our profitability on government contracts will be negatively impacted. In addition, the U.S. federal government has scaled back outsourcing of services in favor of ""insourcing"" jobs to its employees, which could reduce our revenue. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. Our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.",0.12876967,22.2021302222222,54,-0.0988290783333333
831641,"Because we have historically acquired a significant number of companies, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. As of September 29, 2019, our goodwill was $924.8 million and other intangible assets were $16.4 million. We are required to perform a goodwill impairment test for potential impairment at least on an annual basis. We also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. The goodwill impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of our reporting units, which are the components one level below our reportable segments. In determining fair value, we make significant judgments and estimates, including assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations. We also analyze current economic indicators and market valuations to help determine fair value. To the extent economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change, our goodwill may be deemed to be impaired, and we would be required to record a non-cash charge that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. For example, we had goodwill impairment of $7.8 million in fiscal 2019.  We had no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2018.

Like other U.S. companies, our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military actions or terrorist activities and associated political instability, and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce. These uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products. Any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations, causing a decrease in our revenues. If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share, incur costly litigation expenses, suffer incremental price erosion or lose valuable assets, any of which could harm our operations and negatively impact our profitability. Our success depends upon our ability to continue our technological innovation and protect our intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and know-how. We are currently engaged in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, and associated expenses have been, and are expected to remain, material and have adversely affected our operating results. We cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation, or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. From time to time, we have received, and we may receive in the future, communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Costly litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement.

833640,"If demand for our products declines in our major end markets, our net revenues will decrease. A limited number of applications of our products, such as cellphone chargers, LED lights, desktop PCs and consumer appliances make up a significant percentage of our net revenues. We expect that a significant level of our net revenues and operating results will continue to be dependent upon these applications in the near term. The demand for these products has been highly cyclical and has been impacted by economic downturns in the past. Any economic slowdown in the end markets that we serve could cause a slowdown in demand for our ICs. When our customers are not successful in maintaining high levels of demand for their products, their demand for our ICs decreases, which adversely affects our operating results. Any significant downturn in demand in these markets would cause our net revenues to decline and could cause the price of our stock to fall. If our efforts to enhance existing products and introduce new products are not successful, we may not be able to generate demand for our products. Our success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ICs for high-voltage power conversion for existing and new markets, to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers. New product introduction schedules are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the market place, including product development delays and defects. If we fail to develop and sell new products in a timely manner then our net revenues could decline. Our inability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our acquisitions could adversely affect our results. We have made, and in the future intend to make, acquisitions of other businesses and with these acquisitions there is a risk that integration difficulties may cause us not to realize expected benefits.  The success of the acquisitions could depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings (if any) from combining the businesses of the acquired companies and our business, which may take longer to realize than expected.",0.011176819,21.6850075555556,33,3.58945598888889
833640,"Because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy, we may incur substantial expenses before we generate significant revenues, if any. Our products are generally incorporated into a customer's products at the design stage. However, customer decisions to use our products, commonly referred to as design wins, can often require us to expend significant research and development and sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. These significant research and development and sales and marketing resources often precede volume sales, if any, by a year or more. The value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer's product. We cannot assure that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues. If a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product, we may not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that product for many months or years. Our products are sold through distributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers, therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 75%, 77% and 75% of net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

833640,"Intense competition in the high-voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in our average selling price and reduced sales volume of our products. The high-voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and characterized by significant price sensitivity. Our products face competition from alternative technologies, such as linear transformers, discrete switcher power supplies, and other integrated and hybrid solutions. If the price of competing solutions decreases significantly, the cost effectiveness of our products will be adversely affected. If power requirements for applications in which our products are currently utilized go outside the cost-effective range of our products, some of these alternative technologies can be used more cost effectively. In addition, as our patents expire, our competitors could legally begin using the technology covered by the expired patents in their products, potentially increasing the performance of their products and/or decreasing the cost of their products, which may enable our competitors to compete more effectively. Our current patents may or may not inhibit our competitors from getting any benefit from an expired patent.  Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2038. We cannot assure that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market.

833640,"We do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place, or if they cancel or reschedule orders for our products, our operating results and our business may suffer. Our business is characterized by short-term customer orders and shipment schedules, and the ordering patterns of some of our large customers have been unpredictable in the past and will likely remain unpredictable in the future. Not only does the volume of units ordered by particular customers vary substantially from period to period, but also purchase orders received from particular customers often vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes. In addition, customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer. In the past, we have experienced customer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control, and significant cancellations could occur again at any time. Also, a relatively small number of distributors, OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers account for a significant portion of our revenues. Specifically, our top ten customers, including distributors, accounted for 56% and 54% of our net revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. However, a significant portion of these revenues are attributable to sales of our products through distributors of electronic components. These distributors sell our products to a broad, diverse range of end users, including OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, which mitigates the risk of customer concentration to a large degree. Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.  We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption, including but not limited to new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.

Our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability, and our products must meet these specifications. ICs as complex as those we sell often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments. We have from time to time in the past experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems.

Under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls indicates that the Company has not sufficiently developed and/or documented internal controls by which management can review and oversee the Company's financial information to detect and correct material errors or that the personnel responsible for performing the review did not have the sufficient skill set or knowledge of the subject matter to perform a proper assessment.",0.087966621,20.0868225555556,32,0.925415264444444

These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements.  In addition, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.  In many markets where we operate business and cultural norms are different than those in the United States and practices that may violate laws and regulations applicable to us like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and the UK Anti-Bribery Act (""UKBA"") are more commonplace.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures with the intention of ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as channel partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies.  Many of our vendors and strategic business allies also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above.  Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if one or more of our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.  There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition.

Increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the Company's operations.  Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight, including by the USCG, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (""OSHA""), NTSB, EPA, IMO, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the CBP and state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and to regulation by states, port authorities and classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping).  The Company is also subject to regulation under international treaties, such as SOLAS, MARPOL, and the STCW.  These agencies, organizations, regulations and treaties establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved safety standards.  The CBP and USCG are authorized to inspect vessels at will.  The Company has and will continue to spend significant funds to comply with these regulations and treaties.  Failure to comply with these regulations and treaties may cause the Company to incur significant liabilities or restrictions on its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's operations are subject to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks.  The Company is exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks and although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  For instance, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar results in higher prices for U.S. exports, which may adversely affect Inland Services and Ocean Services' operating results.  The Company has, and anticipates that it will continue to have, contracts denominated in foreign currencies.  It is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates.  The Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods, and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.",0.3032257,20.267823,48,1.41653710777778

However, the Company's ability to access the capital markets for long-term financing could be limited by among other things, its existing capital structure, its credit ratings and the health of the shipping, response and overall oil and gas industry.  In addition, volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect the Company's credit availability and related financing costs.  Capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption.  If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the Company's ability to obtain new credit or refinance obligations as they become due, on acceptable terms, if at all, could be adversely affected.  There can be no assurance that such markets will be a reliable source of financing for the Company, which may adversely affect the Company's business. Negative publicity may adversely impact the Company.  Media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by the Company or senior executives, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators.  Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs, impede hiring and divert resources.

Long-haul transportation of refined petroleum products, crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by ship.  Existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in, or do not reach, all of the markets served by Ocean Services' petroleum and chemical carriers.  As a result, the Company's customers require the services provided by Ocean Services to meet demand.  However, the construction and operation of new pipeline segments could replace the demand for Ocean Services' services and have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services' business. The Company engages in hedging activities, which expose it to risks.  For corporate purposes and also as part of its trading activities, the Company has in the past and may in the future use futures and swaps to hedge risks, such as escalation in fuel costs and movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.  However, hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market.  Such purchases expose the Company to risks of meeting margin calls and drawing on its capital, counterparty risk due to failure of an exchange or institution with which it has entered into a swap, incurring higher costs than competitors or similar businesses that do not engage in such strategies, and losses on its investment portfolio.  Such strategies can also cause earnings to be volatile, and the current volatility in the financial markets exacerbates these risks.

For years there have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future.  For example, in a recent congressional review of Puerto Rico's financial circumstances, several proponents of repealing the Jones Act introduced bills in Congress to exempt the island from the Jones Act.  Although the proposals were limited in scope and failed, there is a risk that similar legislation could be reintroduced upon the occurrence of similar future events, which could lead to broader legislation affecting other aspects of the Jones Act. Difficult economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.  The success of the Company's business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside its control and difficult to predict.  Factors such as commodity prices, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, availability and cost of labor, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), elimination or imposition of trade barriers and protective rules, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) can have a material negative impact on the Company's business and investments, which could reduce its revenues and profitability.  Uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead or require businesses to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values and to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts because their access to capital is impeded.  This would in turn affect the Company's profitability or results of operations.  These factors may also adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of the Company's customers.

Inland Services' business is seasonal, and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower in the first and second quarters of the year and higher in the third and fourth quarters, during the grain harvest.  Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year.  Because of these factors, Inland Services' quarterly operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others. If there is a determination that the SMHI Spin-Off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then the Company and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The SMHI Spin-Off was conditioned upon the Company's receipt of an opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, counsel to the Company, substantially to the effect that the separation qualifies as a transaction that is described in Section 355 of the Code.  The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and SEACOR Marine regarding the past and future conduct of each of the company's respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect, the Company and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.  Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or SEACOR Marine after the separation.

SEACOR's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions prohibiting ownership of its Common Stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, in excess of 22.5% of such shares in order to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%.  The Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the Company to redeem such excess shares, including those shares issued upon conversion or exchange of the Company's convertible notes.  The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, by cash or promissory notes.  However, the Company may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because its operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption.  If, for any reason, the Company is unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25% of the Common Stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any such class or series of the Company's capital stock, or fail to exercise its redemption rights because it is unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, the Company will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade.  Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The aging infrastructure on the U.S. Inland Waterways may lead to increased costs and disruptions in Inland Services' operations.

The operation of petroleum and chemical carriers, short-sea container, RollOn/RollOff vessels, Pure Car/Truck Carriers, bulk carriers, towboats, tugs and barges is subject to various risks, including catastrophic disaster, adverse weather, mechanical failure and collision.  For instance, the Company's operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea may be adversely affected by weather, including severe hurricanes and tropical storms.

859598,"A violation of the FCPA may adversely affect the Company's business and operations.  In order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners.  As a U.S. corporation, the Company is subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business.  The Company has adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the FCPA.  Nevertheless, the Company does business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA.  The Company's personnel and intermediaries, including its local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future.

Maritime shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination.  Applicable inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of the Company's vessels, delays in delivering cargoes, and the levying of customs payments, duties, fines and other penalties.  The U.S. government, foreign governments, international organizations, and industry associations have from time-to-time considered ways to expand inspection procedures.  Such changes, if implemented, could impose additional financial and legal obligations on the Company, including additional responsibility for physically inspecting the contents of cargoes it is shipping.  Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on the Company's customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo impractical.

The Company continuously evaluates the acquisition and disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake significant transactions.  Any such transaction could be material to the Company's business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business and the purchase of equity interests or assets.  The form of consideration associated with such transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock, equity interests or loans payable to the Company and its affiliates by the purchaser.  The Company also regularly evaluates the merits of disposing its operating businesses and assets, in whole or in part, which could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests in its subsidiaries (privately or through a public offering), or the spin-off of equity interests of the Company's subsidiaries to its stockholders.  For instance, on June 1, 2017, the Company effected a spin-off of its offshore marine services business, SEACOR Marine, to its stockholders and on July 3, 2017, the Company effected the sale of its 70% interest in Illinois Corn Processing LLC (""ICP""), the company that operated SEACOR's Illinois Corn Processing business segment.

In recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies, major grain exporters and farm cooperatives, importers and distributors of industrial materials, agricultural companies, fertilizer companies, trading companies, and industrial companies, which make up a significant portion of the Company's customer base, have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible.  Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the Company's services, which could adversely affect demand for the Company's petroleum and chemical carriers thereby reducing the Company's revenues. Inland Services' results of operations could be adversely affected by international economic and political factors.  The actions of the United States and foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by Inland Services.  Foreign trade agreements and each country's adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for U.S. imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities that Inland Services transports.  National and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or U.S. imports or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates could affect the demand for the transportation of cargoes handled by Inland Services. Restrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the Company's vessels could limit its ability to sell off any portion of its business or result in the forfeiture of its vessels.  As noted above, compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade.  If the Company were to seek to sell any portion of its business that owns any of these vessels, it would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above.  As a result, the sales price for that portion of the Company's business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unconstrained sale.",0.3032257,20.267823,48,1.41653710777778

The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business.  Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.  Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the Company's operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention.  If the Company suffers an adverse judgment, it may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that could materially adversely affect a portion of its business operations or materially adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inland Services' results of operations could be adversely affected by the decline in U.S. grain exports.  Inland Services' business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including crop harvest yield levels in the United States and abroad, the demand for grain in the United States and international trade wars.  A shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for U.S. grain.  Conversely, an abundance of grain overseas, or international tariffs on U.S. grain, can decrease demand for U.S. grain.  For example, the recently deteriorating trade relationship between the U.S. and China has caused decreased demand for U.S. grain overseas.  A decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity, which would likely lower freight rates earned by Inland Services.",0.3032257,20.267823,48,1.41653710777778

The Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to capture knowledge of its business; to coordinate its business across its operation bases; and to communicate within the Company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties.  These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, cyber-attacks, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events.  The Company's technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to its data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of its data, loss or damage to its data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches.  The Company's information technology systems are becoming increasingly integrated, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact.

The Company is subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between U.S. ports.  Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S.-flag and manned by predominantly U.S. crews.  The Jones Act also requires that vessels engaged in coastwise trade be owned and operated by ""U.S. citizens"" within the meaning of the Jones Act.  Compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% of the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade.

As of December 31, 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues.  The portion of Ocean Services, Inland Services and Witt O'Brien's revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of relevant activity by any such customer, the segment's ability to meet the customer's needs and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control.  The loss by any segment of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on such segment's or the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Further, to the extent any of the Company's customers experience an extended period of operating difficulty, the Company's revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely effected.",0.3032257,20.267823,48,1.41653710777778

From time to time, the Company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or convert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions.  The Company also routinely engages shipyards to dry-dock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Construction and conversion projects and dry-dockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor.  A significant delay in either construction or dry-dockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction, conversion or undergoing dry-dockings.  Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction, conversion or retrofit could also adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. An increase in the supply of vessels, barges or equipment the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the rates earned by the Company's vessels, barges and equipment.  The Company's industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition.  Expansion of the supply of vessels, barges and equipment would increase competition in the markets in which the Company operates.  The refurbishment of disused or ""mothballed"" vessels and barges, conversion of vessels from other uses or construction of new vessels, barges and equipment could all add vessel, barge and equipment capacity to current worldwide levels.

Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy.  There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims.  If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability.  Further, to the extent the proceeds from insurance are not sufficient to repair or replace a damaged asset, the Company would be required to expend funds to supplement the insurance and in certain circumstances may decide that such expenditures are not justified, which, in either case, could adversely affect its liquidity and ability to grow.

The Company's business and stock price may be materially adversely affected if its internal control over financial reporting is not effective.  Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting.  As part of this process, the Company is required to document and test its internal control over financial reporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning the Company's internal control over financial reporting; and the Company's independent registered certified public accounting firm is required to attest on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  In the past, the Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.  While all such identified material weaknesses have been remediated, there can be no assurance that the Company will not identify material weaknesses in its internal control in the future.

As of December 31, 2018, the BP contract, the Petrobras contracts and the contract for the HP I represented approximately 90% of our total backlog.  Due to the value at risk, any cancellation, termination or breach of those contracts would have a larger impact on our operating results and financial condition than shorter term contracts.  The cancellation or termination of, or unwillingness to perform, these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Typically, we charter our ROV support vessels under long-term time charter agreements.  We also have entered into long-term charter agreements for the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels to perform work under our contracts with Petrobras.  Should our contracts with customers be canceled, terminated or breached and/or we do not secure work for the chartered vessels, we are still required to make charter payments.  Making those payments absent revenue generation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Item 1A.

867773,"The market for electric generation products is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government laws, regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry in the United States and abroad, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, and changes that make solar power less competitive with other power sources could deter investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources as well as customer purchases of solar power technology, which could in turn result in a significant reduction in the demand for our solar power products. The market for electric generation equipment is also influenced by trade and local content laws, regulations and policies that can discourage growth and competition in the solar industry and create economic barriers to the purchase of solar power products, thus reducing demand for our solar products. In addition, on-grid applications depend on access to the grid, which is also regulated by government entities. We anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will continue to be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to construction, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, trade, and related matters. It is difficult to track the requirements of individual states or local jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards. In addition, the U.S., European Union and Chinese governments, among others, have imposed tariffs or are in the process of evaluating the imposition of tariffs on solar panels, solar cells, polysilicon, and potentially other components.

At the federal level, the current administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B (such as EYLEA), to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, on May 11, 2018, President Trump laid out his administration's ""Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs"" to reduce the cost of prescription drugs while preserving innovation and cures. The Department of Health and Human Services has been soliciting feedback on some of these measures and may implement others impacting our business under its existing authority. CMS has also recently sought public comment on how best to leverage its authority provided under the Competitive Acquisition Program and introduce competition into Medicare Part B by allowing CMS to bring on vendors to negotiate payment amounts for Medicare Part B drugs. In addition, in August 2018, CMS issued new guidance that recognizes that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may use step therapy (i.e., requiring the use of less costly medications before more costly medications are approved for coverage) for Part B drugs (such as EYLEA), beginning January 1, 2019, as part of a patient-centered care coordination program. CMS will also consider rulemaking related to step therapy that might be appropriate for 2020 and future years. On October 25, 2018, President Trump announced that CMS was evaluating a pilot program that proposes to set the Medicare payment amount for Part B single-source drugs and biologics to more closely align with international drug prices (also referred to as reference pricing) and pay physicians and hospitals participating in such program a set drug add-on payment for administered drugs. CMS also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that requested public comment on the pilot program, which is proposed to initially cover fifty percent of Medicare Part B spending on separately payable Part B drugs (such as EYLEA). Congress and the U.S. administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are becoming increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. In some cases, these measures are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

EYLEA net sales represent a substantial portion of our revenues and this concentration of our net sales in a single product makes us substantially dependent on that product. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, EYLEA net sales in the United States represented 61% and 63% of our total revenues, respectively. If we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of EYLEA in the United States, if Bayer were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States, or if we and Bayer are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of EYLEA, we may experience a reduction in revenue and may not be able to sustain profitability, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.",0.048219547,24.6170283333333,32,4.48223982222222

If Bayer and, in Japan, Santen do not perform their obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to commercialize EYLEA outside the United States will be significantly adversely affected. Bayer has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months' advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. If Bayer were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we may not have the resources or skills to replace those of our collaborator, which could require us to seek another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in the commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States and result in substantial additional costs and/or lower revenues to us.

These cGMP requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task. Manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs.

While we believe MGIC has sufficient claims paying resources to meet its claim obligations on its insurance in force on a timely basis, you should read the rest of these risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect MGIC's claims paying resources. Certain of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than we do (including, through off-shore reinsurance vehicles, which are tax-advantaged). As a result, they may be able to achieve higher after-tax rates of return on their NIW compared to us, which could allow them to leverage reduced premium rates to gain market share, and they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including by participating in alternative forms of credit enhancement pursued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the ""GSEs"") discussed in our risk factor titled ""The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance.""",0.13367519,21.9902334444444,52,-3.26107065333333

In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.

Changes in relationships with the Company's vendor base may adversely affect its business, margins, and profitability. Legal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks The Company faces risks related to the safety of the food products that it manufactures, distributes, and sells. It may need to recall such products for actual or alleged contamination, adulteration, mislabeling, or other safety concerns. The Company's acquisition of Caito has expanded its food production capabilities and ability to offer fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh protein-based foods and complete meals. These products, and other food products that the Company sells, are at risk of contamination by disease-causing organisms such as Salmonella, E. coli, and others. These pathogens are generally found in nature, and as a result, there is a risk that they could be present in the products manufactured, distributed or sold by the Company. The Company typically has little control over proper food handling before the Company's receipt of the product or once the product has been delivered to customers. Contamination risks may be controlled, although not eliminated, by good manufacturing practices and food safety programs. Recall costs can be material. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the administrative costs of a recall, the destruction of inventory, and lost sales. Recalls and other food safety concerns can also result in product liability claims, adverse publicity, damage to the Company's reputation, and a loss of confidence in the safety and quality of its products. Customers may avoid purchasing certain products from the Company, or to seek alternative sources of supply for some or all of their food needs, even if the basis for concern is outside of the Company's control. Any loss of confidence on the part of the Company's customers would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any real or perceived issue regarding the safety of any food or drug items sold by the Company, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on the Company's business.",0.43871468,19.9168422222222,42,6.34915206444444

Further, we rely in part on receiving the principal and interest under certain of our notes and other long-term receivables.

887730,"As disclosed in Part II - Item 9A. ""Controls and Procedures"" of this Form 10-K in the section ""Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,"" a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting resulting from certain control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting pertaining to the initiation and recording of net sales and accounts receivable, net at March 31, 2019. The specific issues leading to these conclusions are described in that section. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The growth of our Company and our expansion into a variety of new products expose us to a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. We are subject to various federal, foreign and state laws, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions. Furthermore, as a result of our acquisition of TOKIN, we assumed all liabilities assessed against TOKIN that may arise as a result of litigation to which TOKIN is a party. Refer to ""Item 3. Legal Proceedings"" for a summary of the Company's material litigation and investigations. The impact of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses, and our reputation may be damaged. The market price for our common stock has been volatile historically. Our stock price may be significantly affected by factors including those described elsewhere in ""Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors,"" as well as the following: Our stock price can be volatile. Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",0.22340649,21.0741862222222,33,7.93473587777778
887921,"Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the U.S. income tax provisions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Competition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses.  If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the 2016 Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation's various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply. However, if the Company's anticipated level of revenue is not achieved because of, for example, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, such as due to the consumption declines in core beauty categories in the mass retail channel in North America, which continues to have a negative impact on net sales of Revlon color cosmetics and SinfulColors color cosmetics; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in brick-and-mortar channels The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products.

The Company's products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Among the factors used by the Company's major customers in assessing the allocation of display space is a brand's share of the color cosmetics category.  The Company's color cosmetics brands have experienced, over time, year-over-year declines in their share of the color cosmetics category in the U.S. and it is possible that the Company may continue to experience further share declines.  Further declines in the Company's share for one or more of its principal brands, including with respect to the Company's Almay brand, could, among other things, contribute to the additional loss of display space and/or decreased revenues.

In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial covenants, including those relating to maximum total leverage, maximum secured leverage, maximum unsecured leverage, minimum fixed charge coverage, minimum consolidated tangible net worth, minimum unsecured debt yield, minimum unsecured interest coverage and maximum distributions. Any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness, conduct our operations, and take advantage of business opportunities as they arise is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants.

888491,"Leases. A bankruptcy filing by one of our lessee operators would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents or evicting the operator, absent approval of the bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Code provides a lessee with the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within certain specified periods of time. Generally, a lessee is required to pay all rent that becomes payable between the date of its bankruptcy filing and the date of the assumption or rejection of the lease (although such payments will likely be delayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing). If one of our lessee operators chooses to assume its lease with us, the operator must promptly cure all monetary defaults existing under the lease (including payment of unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents) and provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future lease obligations. Even where a lessee operator assumes its lease with us, it will first often threaten to reject that lease to obtain better lease terms from us, and we sometimes have to consider making, or we do make, such economic concessions to avoid rejection of the lease and our taking a closed facility back. If one of our lessee operators opts to reject its lease with us, we would have a claim against such operator for unpaid and future rents payable under the lease, but such claim would be subject to a statutory ""cap"" under the Bankruptcy Code, and would likely result in a recovery substantially less than the face value of such claim. Although the operator's rejection of the lease would permit us to recover possession of the leased facility, we would likely face losses, costs and delays associated with repairs and/or maintenance of the facility and then re-leasing the facility to a new operator, or costs associated with selling the facility. In any event, re-leasing a facility or selling it could take a material amount of time, and the pool of interested and qualified tenants or buyers will be limited due to the unique nature of our properties, which may depress values and our eventual recovery.  Finally, whether a lease operator in bankruptcy ends up assuming or rejecting our lease, we will incur legal and collection costs, which can be difficult or impossible to recover. The bankruptcy or insolvency of our operators could limit or delay our ability to recover on our investments.",0.52614409,22.7007412222222,53,-5.95247247111111

889331,"As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, the Company is exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The Company has multiple sources of supply for the majority of its commodity requirements. However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices the Company charges its customers, its product costs, and the competitive position of its products and services. The Company monitors and manages these exposures as an integral part of its overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on its results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of intense price competition and the Company's high level of fixed costs, it may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant portions of its revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates.

This, in turn, requires the Operating Partnership to make distributions to its unitholders.

In addition, in October 2015, we received a request from the DOJ for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to Alexion's compliance with FCPA. The SEC and DOJ also seek information related to Alexion's recalls of specific lots of Soliris and related securities disclosures. Alexion is cooperating with these investigations.  The investigations have focused on operations in various countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Russia and Turkey, and Alexion's compliance with the FCPA and other applicable laws.

The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B ""ceiling price"" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs.  The 340B pricing program is described  in Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement in Item 1 Business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on, among other prices, the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are a participant in the 340B drug pricing program and are, for the applicable covered entities, subject to the price ceiling. Any changes to the 340B drug pricing program, including: We and our current and future third party vendors, contract manufacturers, CROs, distributors and suppliers and logistic providers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by governmental authorities around the world, including the FDA, EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and the MHLW.

If any governmental authority determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute improper promotion of any of our products, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, product withdrawal or recall, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds.

899923,"The market prices for securities of molecular diagnostic companies have been volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices for these securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly since public trading commenced in October 1995, and it is likely that the market price will continue to fluctuate in the future.  In the two years ended June 30, 2019, our stock price has ranged from $22.07 per share to $50.44 per share.  In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Events or factors that may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock include the following: We rely on a CLIA-certified and FDA approved laboratory facility in Salt Lake City, Utah to perform most of our molecular diagnostic tests; a CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California to perform our Foresight and Prequel tests; a single laboratory facility in Cologne, Germany to perform and produce our EndoPredict test kits; a CLIA-certified lab in Mason, Ohio to perform our GeneSight test; and a CLIA-certified laboratory facility in Austin, Texas to perform our pharmaceutical and clinical testing services. These facilities and certain pieces of laboratory equipment would be difficult to replace and may require significant replacement lead-time. In the event our clinical testing facilities were to lose their CLIA certification or other required certifications or licenses or were affected by a man-made or natural disaster, we would be unable to continue our molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services business at current levels to meet customer demands for a significant period of time.

Importantly, in 2014 we launched our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test, which represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer testing franchise. We anticipate that the myRisk Hereditary Cancer test will eventually replace our current predictive medicine test offerings (BRACAnalysis, BART, Colaris and Colaris AP and Melaris) with a single comprehensive test.  However, we may not be successful in transitioning from our existing product portfolio to our new tests and in launching and commercializing our new tests. The demand for our existing molecular diagnostic tests may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates due to sales of the myRisk Hereditary Cancer test and our other new tests that are replacing our existing product portfolio, or for other reasons. For example, because most of our molecular diagnostic tests are only utilized once per patient, we will need to sell our services through physicians to new patients or develop new molecular diagnostic tests in order to continue to generate revenue.  Our pipeline of new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic test candidates is in various stages of development and may take several more years to develop and must undergo extensive clinical validation. We may be unable to discover or develop any additional molecular diagnostic or companion diagnostic tests through the utilization of our technologies or technologies we license or acquire from others.

Dividends that are effectively connected with a United States trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding.

Because the loans originated under such programs are unsecured, in the event a borrower does not repay the loan in accordance with its terms or otherwise defaults on the loan, the Bank may not be able to recover from the borrower an amount sufficient to pay any remaining balance on the loan.

See Part I, Item 1 ""Business - Regulation and Supervision - Holding Company Regulation and Supervision."" Given the power provided to the federal banking agencies, we, as a source of strength for the Bank, may be required to contribute capital to the Bank when we might not otherwise voluntarily choose to do so.  Specifically, the imposition of such financial requirements might require us to raise additional capital to support the Bank at a time when it is not otherwise prudent for us to do so, including on terms that are not typical or favorable to us. See ""We are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and, if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to growth opportunities, losses or an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our compliance with regulatory requirements, would be adversely affected.""  Further, any capital provided by us to the Bank would be subordinate to others with interest in the Bank, including the Bank's depositors.

908311,"The business of CIM Urban is managed by Urban GP Administrator and we agreed in the Master Services Agreement to appoint an affiliate of CIM Group as the manager of the general partner of CIM Urban; in addition, the general partner of CIM Urban can be removed from that position under certain circumstances as provided in the CIM Urban Partnership Agreement. Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on its balance sheet. If the lease does not meet the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is to be considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to enhance a tenant's balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") and the International Accounting Standards Board conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, Leases (""ASU 2016-02""), which will require that a tenant recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, with the result being the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability and the disclosure of key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. These and other potential changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants. These changes may affect how our real estate leasing business is conducted. For example, with the ASU 2016-02 revision, companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets under current practice could be reduced or eliminated. This impact in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.",0.438521,18.9553365555556,53,-5.19876203888889

Further, in December 2018, CMS issued a final rule for the MSSP, which among other things, requires ACOs to accept a two-sided risk model (as opposed to a one-sided model), wherein ACOs need to share in the financial risk of their patients' healthcare spending (i.e., shared losses) in addition to shared savings.

927066,"Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government laws and regulations, such as Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark Law and analogous state self-referral prohibition statutes, the 21st Century Cures Act, Federal Acquisition Regulations, the False Claims Act (FCA) and associated regulations, the Civil Monetary Penalty statute and associated regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and the storage, handling, shipment, disposal and/or dispensing of pharmaceuticals and blood products and other biological materials and many other applicable state and federal laws and requirements. Medicare and Medicaid regulations, manual provisions, local coverage determinations, national coverage determinations and agency guidance impose complex and extensive requirements upon healthcare providers as well. Moreover, the various laws and regulations that apply to our operations are often subject to varying interpretations and additional laws and regulations potentially affecting providers continue to be promulgated that may impact us. A violation or departure from any of the legal requirements implicated by our business may result in, among other things, government audits, lower reimbursements, significant fines and penalties, the potential loss of certification, recoupment efforts or voluntary repayments. These legal requirements are civil, criminal and administrative in nature depending on the law or requirement.",0.64558321,22.9971244444444,62,1.84530760555556
927628,"Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that efficiently meet their expectations in a cost-effective manner. The development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them. We actively invest in such technology platforms, however, we may fail to implement the correct technology, or may fail to do so in a timely manner as discussed in more detail above under the headings ""We Face Intense Competition In All Of Our Markets"" and ""We Face Risks Related To Our Operational, Technological And Organizational Infrastructure."" Regulation and oversight of the financial services industry is expansive and complex. A wide array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including significant fines and criminal sanctions, and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulators or the public. In addition, establishing and maintaining compliance-related systems, infrastructure and processes is expensive and can limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. Regulatory changes have led to higher expectations for the amount of capital and liquidity we must maintain than were required before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (as discussed in more detail below under the heading ""We May Not Be Able To Maintain Adequate Capital Or Liquidity Levels, Which Could Have A Negative Impact On Our Financial Results And Our Ability To Return Capital To Our Stockholders"") and higher operational costs, which may further increase as regulators continue to implement such reforms. Furthermore, applicable rules and regulations may affect us in an unforeseen manner, or may have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors.",0.14717764,24.2295824444444,52,-3.08859297555556
927628,"Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do. In addition, we face intense competition from smaller companies which experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements and scrutiny than we do, and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can. See ""We Face Intense Competition In All Of Our Markets."" Further, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leaders, engineers and other talent, and competition for such talent is intense. If we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent, our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner, could negatively impact our business and financial results.

927628,"In addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. For example, increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers, which may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated. This could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. These changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. An inability to attract or maintain deposits could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position. Many other financial institutions have increased their reliance on deposit funding and, as such, we expect continued competition in the deposit markets. We cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing. Finally, the Basel III Capital Rule requires that certain amounts reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""), including unrealized gains and losses on securities designated as available for sale, be included in our regulatory capital calculations. Changes in interest rates or market valuations that result in unrealized losses on components of AOCI could therefore impact our regulatory capital ratios negatively. Further, to the extent that we change our retail distribution strategy and as a result expand into new business areas, we may face more competitors with more experience in the new business areas and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome regulations. See ""We Face Intense Competition In All Our Markets.""",0.14717764,24.2295824444444,52,-3.08859297555556
928022,"Unless we replace our oil and gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline. Our future oil and gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our production, revenues, reserve quantities and cash flows will decline. In general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. We may not be successful in finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves, and our efforts may not be economic. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to certain financial, economic, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our hedging program may limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices or may result in losses or may be inadequate to protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in commodity prices. We enter into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. Our hedges at December 31, 2018 are in the form of collars, put and call options, basis swaps, and other structures placed with the commodity trading branches of certain national banking institutions and with certain other commodity trading groups. These hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the market or spot prices for oil and natural gas. We cannot assure you that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in oil and natural gas prices. To the extent that oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or decline further, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same pricing level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.",0.45424178,19.9411198888889,21,3.17645217211111
928022,"The inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.  Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, refineries and affiliates, advances to joint interest parties and joint interest receivables. We are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of We have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  The terms of our Credit Facility contain limitations that impact our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. In addition, any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve our leverage position. An element of our business strategy involves maintaining a disciplined approach to financial management. However, we are also seeking to acquire, exploit and develop additional reserves that may require the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Although we will seek to maintain or improve our leverage position, our ability to maintain or reduce our level of indebtedness depends on a variety of factors, including future performance and our future debt financing needs. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will also affect our ability to maintain or improve our leverage position.

(Cercacor), which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, and evolving interpretations thereof, have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. For example, in recent years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting standards that impact our reporting of revenue and expenses, including Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) and ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). Changes made by these new accounting standards not only apply prospectively, but depending on the method of adoption, may also recast previously reported results. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act, which took effect on January 1, 2018, included a number of changes to existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time transition tax on the ""deemed repatriation"" of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 and changes in the prospective taxation of the foreign operations of U.S. multinational companies. Moreover, Congressional leaders have recognized that the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review is likely to have led to drafting errors, issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that will have to be reviewed in subsequent tax legislation or addressed in future tax regulations.

937556,"From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. For example, in August 2017, Congress enacted the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA). FDARA reauthorized the FDA to collect device user fees, including a new user fee for de novo classification requests, and contained substantive amendments to the device provisions of the FDCA. Among other changes, FDARA required that the FDA update and revise its processes for scheduling inspections of device establishments, communicating about those inspections with manufacturers and providing feedback on the manufacturer's responses to Form 483s. The statute also required that the FDA study the impact of device servicing, including third party servicers, and creates a new process for device sponsors to request classification of accessory devices as part of the PMA application for the parent device or to request a separate classification of accessory devices. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must first undergo premarket review pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) by receiving clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, receiving clearance through the de novo review process, or obtaining approval of a premarket approval (PMA) application. Even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, the FDA may clear or approve our products only for limited indications for use. Additionally, the FDA may not grant 510(k) clearance on a timely basis, if at all, for new products or uses that we propose for Masimo SET® or licensed rainbow® technology.",0.014674155,22.9529257777778,33,3.68269753222222

We may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For device modifications that we conclude do not require a new 510(k), we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices if the FDA disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may elect not to declare cash dividends on our stock, may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis, or may elect not to make any additional stock repurchases. As a result, any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock.

In addition, certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting our used single-patient-use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing, repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals. These imitation and third-party reprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors. Our experience with both these imitation sensors and third-party reprocessed sensors is that they provide inferior performance, increased sensor consumption, reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems. Notwithstanding these limitations, some of our customers have indicated a willingness to purchase some of their sensor requirements from these imitation manufacturers and third-party reprocessors in an effort to reduce their sensor costs.

These individuals, commonly known as relators or ""whistleblowers,"" may potentially then share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend civil False Claims Act actions. When an entity is determined to have violated the civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim.

The legislation includes, inter alia, measures to expedite the development and approval of generic products, where generic competition is lacking even in the absence of exclusivities or listed patents. The FDA has also released a Drug Competition Action Plan, which proposes actions to broaden access to generic drugs and lower consumers' health care costs by, among other things, improving the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and supporting the development of complex generic drugs, and the FDA has taken steps to implement this plan. Moreover, both Congress and the FDA are considering various legislative and regulatory proposals that would limit or reduce the term for patent exclusivity or regulatory exclusivity in the biopharmaceutical industry.

In addition, the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter, due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season. Demand for and sales of titles in our NBA 2K series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the NBA season. If a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or canceled, our sales might also suffer disproportionately. Our failure or inability to produce ""hit"" titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

We could incur additional borrowings on our line of credit in the future to finance increases in working capital, fund capital expenditures, fund negative operating cash flows, or for other corporate purposes. These borrowings could become significant in the future. Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages, and other labor matters. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 148 employees that were represented by labor unions. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and the labor unions are good, no assurances can be made that we will not experience conflicts with labor unions, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, especially in the context of any future negotiations with our labor unions.

The arbitration, which was filed more than two years after the .web auction took place, seeks to compel ICANN to award the .web TLD to Afilias.  Neither Verisign nor NDC currently are parties in the Afilias arbitration, but both have filed requests to participate in the arbitration as interested parties as allowed by ICANN's rules.

Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities for any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. While we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months, if we are unable to generate sufficient product revenue, or access sufficient funds under our BARDA agreement or the public and private equity and debt capital markets, we may be unable to execute successfully on our operating plan.

For example, in 2015, a limited-time offer of our                      ageLOC Me customized skin care system in South Korea generated less revenue than we expected. In that       offer, we bundled the ageLOC Me device with a 12-month product subscription commitment, which we believe may have muted initial sales and contributed to the       lower-than-expected results. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if our products fail to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance. For example, our ageLOC Me customized skin care system contains a large number of SKUs, and       there is a degree of unpredictability in forecasting inventory needs globally due to the complexity and number of customized cartridges available. During the initial launch of ageLOC                        Me, we experienced production difficulties and a slightly higher return rate and complaint rate. Although these issues have been addressed, any future problems with ageLOC                        Me or our other products, including our ageLOC LumiSpa skin treatment and cleansing device, could lead to an increase in product returns or stock-outs and       negatively impact our reputation, revenue and profitability.",0.28660783,20.921496,32,-0.197683248888889

Value-based reimbursement is increasing; CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved.  Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare.  Healthcare industry participants are consolidating.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine, digital pathology).  Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services. Our people are a critical resource. The supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong.

The timing of the proposed exit is subject to further change; however, it is currently scheduled for as late as October 31, 2019, with a transition period expected to run through December 31, 2020. The political uncertainty that it has raised extends to regulatory uncertainty associated with the proposed exit from the EU. Since the vote to withdraw from the EU, negotiations and arrangements between the United Kingdom, the EU and other countries outside of the EU have been, and will continue to be, complex and time consuming. The potential withdrawal could adversely impact our UK subsidiary, 8x8 UK Limited (previously referred to as Voicenet Solutions Ltd.), and add operational complexities that did not previously exist. Currently, the most immediate impact may be to the relevant regulatory regimes under which 8x8 UK Limited operates, including the offering of communications services, as well as to data privacy regulations. The impact on regulatory regimes remains uncertain. For example, while the United Kingdom government has announced its intent to introduce domestic legislation that would largely reconcile United Kingdom domestic law with many EU laws, including GDPR, it remains unknown what will actually occur it what the departure from the EU may mean with respect to data privacy regulation including its impact on data transfers from the EU to the United Kingdom, and vice versa, as well as data transfers from the United Kingdom to jurisdictions outside of the EU. Also, it remains unclear what impact a United Kingdom withdrawal may have on taxes which may increase the cost of our services sold in the United Kingdom, or reduce our profit margins, or make our services less competitive with traditional communications service providers, or some combination of any of these potential issues.  Additionally, the impending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has resulted in significant volatility in the international financial currency markets.

For example, certain retailers account for over 10% of our net revenues in certain geographies, including the U.S. Our success is dependent on our ability to manage our retailer relationships, including offering trade terms on mutually acceptable terms. Furthermore, increased online competition and declining in-store traffic has resulted, and may continue to result, in brick-and-mortar retailers closing physical stores, which could negatively impact our distribution strategies and/or sales if such retailers decide to significantly reduce their inventory levels for our products (as recently occurred with key customers for OPI in North America) or to designate more shelf space to our competitors. Additionally, these retailers periodically assess the allocation of shelf space and have elected (and could further elect) to reduce the shelf space allocated to our products. Some of our brands, including CoverGirl, have experienced shelf space losses, and such declines may continue. Further consolidation and store closures, or reduction in inventory levels of our products or shelf space devoted to our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities.

The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For instance, if our financial results are below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock could decrease, perhaps significantly. Other factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include announcements relating to significant corporate transactions; operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us; future sales by us or our subsidiaries of equity, equity-related or debt securities; the amount, if any, of dividends that we pay on our common stock; anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; changes in regional, national or global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility; and changes in government regulation or proposals relating to us. In addition, the U.S. and global securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.

1024795,"If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. In the Electronics segment particularly, we rely significantly on trade secrets, including unpatented software algorithms, know-how, technology, and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect software algorithms through encryption mechanisms in the distribution of our binary files used in programming our engine control products. However, we cannot guarantee that these encryption techniques can protect all or any portion of these binary files. In practice, we seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. In practice, we also enter into confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with certain of our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they bring against us, to determine ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the procedures we have followed to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",0.30619985,20.9487783333333,33,6.1088075
1024795,"Regulations related to ""conflict minerals"" may force us to incur additional expenses and may result in damage to our reputation. We are subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations applicable to companies that use certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, in their products or in the production of their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require us to conduct an inquiry into the country of origin of the conflict minerals used, and if it is determined that the conflict minerals used may have originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or other covered countries, conduct due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products or in the manufacturing process. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be conflict mineral free. If we are unable to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new commercial products, our business will be adversely affected. The industries we serve in the Electronics segment experience ongoing technological change and product improvement. Manufacturers periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products or to respond to industry developments or needs. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in our markets, as well as our ability to acquire new product technologies or to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in this constantly changing environment. We must continue to identify, develop, manufacture and market innovative products on a timely basis to replace existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and competitive position. We may not be successful in acquiring and developing new products or technologies and any of our new products may not be accepted by our customers. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations in the markets we serve, our business will be adversely affected.

1029800,"Construction and renovation risks could adversely affect our profitability. We currently are         renovating some of our properties and may in the future renovate other properties, including tenant improvements required under leases.  Our renovation and related construction activities may expose us to certain risks.  We may incur renovation         costs for a property which exceed our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that are unexpected.  We also may be unable to complete renovation of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt         service expense or construction costs.  Additionally, some tenants may have the right to terminate their leases if a renovation project is not completed on time.  The time frame required to recoup our renovation and construction costs and to         realize a return on such costs can often be significant. We           are dependent on anchor tenants in many of our retail properties.  Most of our retail properties are dependent on a major or anchor         tenant, often a supermarket anchor.  If we are unable to renew any lease we have with the anchor tenant at one of these properties upon expiration of the current lease on favorable terms, or to re-lease the space to another anchor tenant of similar         or better quality upon departure of an existing anchor tenant on similar or better terms, we could experience material adverse consequences with respect to such property such as higher vacancy, re-leasing on less favorable economic terms, reduced         net income, reduced funds from operations and reduced property values.  Vacated anchor space also could adversely affect a property because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power.  Loss of customer drawing power also can         occur through the exercise of the right that some anchors have to vacate and prevent re-tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, vacated anchor space could, under certain circumstances, permit other tenants to pay a         reduced rent or terminate their leases at the affected property, which could adversely affect the future income from such property.  There can be no assurance that our anchor tenants will renew their leases when they expire or will be willing to         renew on similar economic terms.  See Item 1. Business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our ten largest tenants by percent of total annual base rent of our properties.",0.31941971,19.4298581666667,53,-6.74126952138889

Our primary investment         focus is neighborhood and community shopping centers, with a concentration in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York.  For the year ended October 31, 2018, approximately 98.3% of our total revenues were from         properties located in this area. Various factors may adversely affect a shopping center's profitability.  These factors include circumstances that affect consumer spending, such as general economic conditions, economic business cycles, rates of         employment, income growth, interest rates and general consumer sentiment, as well as weather patterns and natural disasters that could have a more significant localized effect in the areas where our properties are concentrated.  Changes to the real         estate market in our focus areas, such as an increase in retail space or a decrease in demand for shopping center properties, could adversely affect operating results.

Since our         founding in 1969, we have operated, and intend to continue to operate, in a manner that enables us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  However, the federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex.  The determination that we         qualify as a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be completely within our control.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, such as         rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  In addition, to qualify as a REIT, we cannot own specified amounts of debt and equity securities of some issuers.  We also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT         taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year. Our continued qualification as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of the asset, income, organizational, distribution and stockholder ownership requirements of the Internal Revenue Code on a         continuing basis. At any time, new laws, interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal tax consequences of qualification as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for         certain Internal Revenue Code relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  In addition, distributions to stockholders would not be         deductible in computing our taxable income.  Corporate tax liability would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders which, in turn, would reduce the market price of our stock.  Unless entitled to relief under certain         Internal Revenue Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. We will pay federal taxes if we do not distribute 100% of our taxable income.  To the extent         that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income.  In addition, we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in         any year are less than the sum of:",0.31941971,19.4298581666667,53,-6.74126952138889

Hospitals may not follow cleaning and sterilization instructions properly, or equipment used for cleaning and sterilization may malfunction or be used improperly. If our customers deviate from cleaning and sterilization instructions, regulatory authorities may require them to suspend use of da Vinci Surgical Systems. The sales and purchase order cycle of our da Vinci Surgical System is lengthy because it is a major capital item and its purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and government bodies, as applicable. In addition, sales to some of our customers are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. These approval and bidding processes can be lengthy. As a result, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines. Further, IDN groups are creating larger networks of da Vinci system users with increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their robotic-assisted surgery programs to optimize the efficiency of surgeries using the da Vinci system. Further, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, lighter in the first fiscal quarter and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, third-party service providers that provide services to da Vinci Surgical System operators may emerge and compete with us on price or offerings.

We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However, significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. In the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands arising from imitation of our products. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all.

Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensees, or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself.

See Item 3  -  ""Legal Proceedings"" for further discussion of our Company's legal matters. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, there continues to be concerns regarding trade relations between the U.S. and China, as both countries recently imposed significant new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories, and additional tariffs have been proposed. As approximately one-third of our products are sourced from China, the U.S.'s imposition of new tariffs on apparel or other goods imported from China could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales and profitability. Although we are actively reviewing options to mitigate our exposure in the event any resulting tariffs impact our product categories, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any increased costs.

Most of our coal supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal that satisfies certain quality specifications, such as heat value, sulfur content, ash content, hardness and ash fusion temperature. These provisions in our coal supply agreements could result in negative economic consequences to us, including price adjustments, having to purchase replacement coal in a higher-priced open market, the rejection of deliveries or, in the extreme, contract termination. Our profitability may be negatively affected if we are unable to seek protection during adverse economic conditions or if we incur financial or other economic penalties as a result of these provisions of our coal supply agreements. For more information about our long-term coal supply agreements, you should see the section entitled ""Long-Term Coal Supply Arrangements"" under Item 1. Federal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re - open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third - party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re - open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments, the extension of time for delivery or the termination of customers' contracts.

1037976,"Seeking Opportunities in Risks. Risks in business can also mean opportunity if they can be translated into services that help clients mitigate their own risks and for which they are willing to pay fees that adequately compensate the provider for the risks being absorbed. An example of how we may be able to monetize the absorption of risks is our ability to charge fees for taking on, as principal, the risks of performance of subcontractors so that our clients do not have to bear them directly. Another example is our experience and ability to conduct business with integrity in emerging markets that are generally perceived to be less transparent. This allows us to charge fees to multi-national firms that want to expand their footprint into new markets with the assistance of service providers they can trust to protect their interests and act according to ethical and other best practices. In 2018, we invested in transformation initiatives, such as our global enterprise resource planning implementation and client-facing technology; our patent for Blackbird, a proprietary visualization and data capability that enables quicker client site selection; and the creation of JLL Spark Global Venture Fund, which invests in technology focused on real estate. While we expect to realize efficiencies from these initiatives, there is no guarantee that we will recognize the full efficiency, cost reduction and other benefits of these activities that we expect. In connection with such activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions critical to our strategy. If our business transformation initiatives are not successful, or if they are not executed effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. These initiatives involve costs relating to hiring outside experts and implementing these projects, and could have unanticipated costs or unrealized savings.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02""). ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.

We must attract, develop and retain a growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to adequately attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees in the future, or to replace retiring key executives which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain life or disability insurance for our key executives. We face the possibility of operational interruptions related to union work stoppages. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Failure to adequately maintain our systems and disruptions in our systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity. A few of our stockholders own approximately 24.2% of our voting stock as of August 31, 2019,  which may make it difficult to complete some corporate transactions without their support and may impede a change in control.

Prologis, Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe Prologis, Inc. has been organized and operated to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable Prologis, Inc. to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause Prologis, Inc. to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, Prologis, Inc. must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, Prologis, Inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years that end on or before December 31, and in some cases declared as late as December 31, a REIT can satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of other property or shares of our stock if certain conditions are met.

1052100,"There May Be Adverse Effects On Our Business If Our Funds' Performance Declines.  Success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses, including the growth and retention of AUM, is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds. Good relative performance stimulates sales of the Funds' shares and tends to keep redemptions low.  Sales of the Funds' shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues. Good relative performance may also attract institutional accounts.  It may also result in higher ratings or rankings by research services such as Morningstar, Lipper or eVestment Alliance, which may compound the foregoing effects. Conversely, poor relative performance results in decreased sales, increased redemptions of the Funds' shares and the loss of institutional accounts, resulting in decreases in our AUM and revenues.  Poor investment performance also may adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties.  Further, any drop in market share of mutual fund sales in our broker-dealer channel may further reduce profits as sales of unaffiliated mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our affiliated mutual funds.  As of December 31, 2018, 37% our AUM were concentrated in five Funds. As a result, our operating results are significantly affected by the performance of those Funds and our ability to minimize redemptions from and maintain AUM in those Funds. If we experienced a significant amount of redemptions of those Funds for any reason, our revenues would decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, any adverse performance of those Funds may also indirectly affect the net sales and redemptions in our other products, which in turn, may adversely affect our business.  We have experienced net outflows in recent years due in part to underperformance of our mutual funds and depressed sales.

The federal funds target rate, which drives short-term interest rates, had been close to zero for nearly seven years prior to the December 2015 increase.

De novo branching and acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals.  The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo banking locations could impact our business plans and restrict our growth. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies.  In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new capital rules, referred to herein as the Basel III capital rules, which revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets.  The Basel III capital rules apply to all bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in consolidated assets and all banks regardless of size.

More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates.  Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition with other financial institutions, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new banking locations and the consummation of acquisitions.

Many states have false claim act and anti-kickback statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act and the federal anti-kickback statute.

1077428,"Our mortgage finance business has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, highly variable usage of our funding capacity resulting from seasonal demands for credit, surges in consumer demand driven by changes in interest rates and month-end ""spikes"" of residential mortgage closings. These spikes could also result in our Bank having capital ratios that are below internally targeted levels or even levels that could cause our Bank to not be well capitalized and could affect liquidity levels.  At the same time managing this risk by declining to respond fully to the needs of our customers could severely impact our business. We have responded to these variable funding demands by, among other things, increasing the extent of participations sold in our mortgage loan interests, as needed, and by maintaining a substantial borrowing relationship with the FHLB. Our mortgage finance customers have in recent periods provided significant low-cost deposit balances associated with the borrower escrow accounts created at the time certain mortgage loans are funded, which have benefitted our liquidity and net interest margin. Due to the rising rate environment and in response to competitive pressures, we have found it necessary to pay interest on some of these accounts, as regulations allow or require and this trend may continue, materially increasing our costs of funds.  Individual escrow account balances also experience significant variability monthly as principal and interest payments, as well as ad valorem taxes and insurance premiums, are paid periodically. While the short average holding period of our mortgage interests of approximately 20 days will allow us, if necessitated by a funding shortfall, to rapidly decrease the size of the portfolio and its associated capital and funding requirements, any such action might significantly damage our business and important mortgage finance relationships. Claims and legal actions may result in significant legal costs to defend us or assert our rights and may result in reputational damage that adversely affects existing and future customer relationships. If claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us we may suffer significant financial liability or adverse effects upon our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting CECL on our future reported financial results. We believe that the impact of the adoption of CECL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts, as of the adoption date.

Our customer service and fulfillment networks, and any further expansion of those networks, along with other aspects of our evolving business, may result in additional sales and use tax obligations. An increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state retailers to collect taxes on their behalf, and the recent June 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al. enables states to consider adopting laws requiring out-of-state sellers to collect and remit sales tax, even in states in which the seller has no physical presence.

1086600,"We compete with other coal producers in various regions of the United States for domestic coal sales.  In addition, we face competition from foreign and domestic producers that sell their coal in the international coal markets.  The most important factors on which we compete are delivered price (i.e., the cost of coal delivered to the customer, including transportation costs, which are generally paid by our customers either directly or indirectly), coal quality characteristics, contract flexibility (e.g., volume optionality and multiple supply sources) and reliability of supply.

The competition among coal producers may impact our ability to retain or attract customers and could adversely impact our revenues and cash available for distribution.

Any point of failure within the Internet infrastructure, whether caused by network hackers, force majeure type events or otherwise, could have a significant adverse effect on WWE Network. In addition, devices for accessing our content are manufactured and sold by entities other than the Company, and any transmission issues through these devices may result in consumer dissatisfaction with WWE Network and adversely affect our business. Technology changes may require that platforms and/or subscribers update their devices and any failure to do so, or the failure of us or our distribution partners to perform adequately through these updated devices could negatively affect our subscribers' enjoyment of WWE Network which would negatively affect our business. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers (such as through tiered access or pricing), due to the heavy bandwidth use of audio/visual content, we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition costs, and subscriber numbers, could be negatively impacted.

1093557,"Our products are purchased principally by individual patients, who may be eligible for insurance coverage of their devices from various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans, and managed care plans. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department for Health & Human Services, including CMS, as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services. The principal U.S. federal laws that implicate reimbursement issues include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the federal civil False Claims Act, (ii) unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute, and (iii) health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the physician self-referral law, or the ""Stark Law."" Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other government-funded programs, as well as, in some cases, to all payors. In addition, the federal overpayment statute, as interpreted by CMS, requires the report and return of identified overpayments received from federal health care programs within 60 days of identification and quantification, and requires the exercise of reasonable diligence to investigate credible information regarding potential overpayments. Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action claiming treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Additionally, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA - approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. On October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the ""Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act."" This law, in part (under a provision entitled ""Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine""), extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners.

Any subsequent modification of our G6 that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness (for example, a significant change in design or manufacture), or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require us to obtain a new 510(k) clearance or could require a new de novo submission or a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer's determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until appropriate clearance or approval is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. We may never receive approval, marketing authorization or clearance from the U.S. FDA and other governmental agencies to market additional CGM systems, expanded indications for use of current and future generation CGM systems, future software platforms, or any other products under development.

1093557,"Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices, including those which may arise from the misuse (including system hacking or other unauthorized access by third parties to our systems) or malfunction of, or design flaws in, our products. This liability may vary based on the FDA classification associated with our devices. Notably, the classification of our G6 system as a Class II medical device is likely to weaken our ability to rely on federal preemption of state law claims that assert liability against us for harms arising from use of the G6. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by customers, healthcare providers or others selling our products. The risk of product liability claims may increase now that our G5 Mobile system has obtained indications and approved labeling in the United States, in Canada, and in the countries utilizing the CE Mark that allow for our patients to make diabetes treatment decisions with our CGM technology in conjunction with only two finger sticks required for calibration of the system and our G6 does not require confirmatory finger sticks when making treatment decisions or finger stick tests each day for calibration, although it does require finger stick tests when symptoms do not match readings and when readings are unavailable.  The risk of claims may also increase if our products are subject to a product recall or seizure. An example of the difficulty of complying with the regulatory requirements associated with the manufacture of our products, we issued notifications to our customers regarding the audible alarms and alerts associated with our receivers, as discussed earlier in the risk factor entitled ""If we or our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, the products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market."" The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of FDA marketing applications or supplements, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: In March 2018, via the de novo process, the FDA classified the G6 and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type (""integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems"" or ""iCGMs"") into Class II, meaning that going forward products of this generic type may utilize the 510(k) pathway.",0.48463467,23.8781001111111,33,2.10320526666667
1093557,"Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or ""whistleblower,"" suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Depending upon whether the underlying conduct alleged in such inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, the resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. If future product candidates are not deemed by the FDA to meet the criteria for submission under the 510(k) pathway, or for down-classification under the de novo process or otherwise, we would need to pursue a PMA. The PMA process requires us to prove the safety and effectiveness of our systems to the FDA's satisfaction. This process can be expensive, prolonged and uncertain, requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and human clinical data, and may never result in the FDA granting a PMA. In March 2018, our G6 system received de novo classification from the FDA to be a Class II medical device. The de novo classification under the generic name ""integrated continuous glucose monitoring system,"" makes the G6 a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions. Complying with this classification requires ongoing compliance with the general controls required by the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and the special controls specified by the FDA's G6 order. Any future system or expanded indications for use of current generation systems will require approval of the applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, we intend to seek either 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals for certain changes and modifications to our existing software platform, but cannot predict when, if ever, those changes and modifications will be approved.

We filed a patent infringement lawsuit against AgaMatrix in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, or C.D. Cal., which is currently on appeal to the Federal Circuit based on a Final Judgment of non-infringement entered by the C.D. Cal. judge on February 23, 2018. AgaMatrix sought attorneys' fees for this lawsuit and as of December 31, 2018 we have accrued an immaterial amount for those fees. On September 15, 2017, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against AgaMatrix in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting certain single-point blood glucose monitoring products of AgaMatrix infringe two patents held by us. In addition, on September 18, 2017, we filed a Complaint against AgaMatrix in the International Trade Commission, referred to as the ITC, requesting that the ITC institute an investigation and issue an order excluding certain products of AgaMatrix from importation into or sale in the United States based on AgaMatrix's infringement of the same two patents asserted in the Delaware litigation. On September 14, 2018, AgaMatrix filed two petitions for inter partes review for each of the same two patents we asserted in the District of Delaware and the ITC. We filed a response to all four petitions on December 17, 2018. AgaMatrix had requested additional briefing on the matter and the PTAB has authorized both sides to do so. Briefing was completed in January 2019. Additionally, if we violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, or retain overpayments longer than 60 days after identification, or fail to act with reasonable diligence to investigate credible information regarding potential overpayments, we may be found to violate the federal civil False Claims Act, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam relator, or ""whistleblower,"" suit.

The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Senior Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes. As a result, we are required to record a non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include the amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock.

1094810,"Non-Residential Consumer Loans.  At December 31, 2018, $267.2 million, or 17.8% of our total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans, of which $43.7 million consisted of automobile loans, $216.6 million consisted of boat/RV loans and $6.9 million consisted of other consumer loans, including unsecured lines of credit.  Generally, we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to mortgage loans on one-to-four family, owner-occupied residential properties, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles.  In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.  Although our indirect loans, which totaled $244.8 million at December 31, 2018, were underwritten by a third party using our guidelines, they were primarily originated to customers outside of our normal lending area which presents greater risks than other types of lending activities. As a result of this portfolio of consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase the level of our provision for loan losses, which could negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. Adjustable Rate Loans.  At December 31, 2018, $743.9 million, or 49.6% of our total loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans.  Borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin.  Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable-rate loans, increasing the possibility of default.  Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparable or lower interest rates.  In addition, declining real estate prices may prevent refinancing or a sale of the property, because borrowers have insufficient equity in the real estate.  These events, alone or in combination, may contribute to higher delinquency rates and negatively impact our earnings.",0.12892824,19.4036261111111,52,-1.89169641666667

For operating and finance leases, a lessee will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its statement of financial position. Lessees under operating leases will be required to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term generally on a straight-line basis, and classify all cash payments within operating activities in its statement of cash flows. Lessees under finance leases will be required to recognize interest expense on the lease liability (under the effective interest method) and amortization expense of the right-of-use asset (generally on a straight line basis), each reflected separately in its statement of operations. For operating lease arrangements for which we are the lessee, primarily under leases of office space and certain ground leases, we expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

Under the ODA, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition. The company that obtains the first regulatory approval from the FDA for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease generally receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. Similar laws exist in the EU with a term of ten years. See Business - Government Regulation - Orphan Drug Designation in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-K for additional information. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication or disease before us, and the FDA grants such orphan drug exclusivity, we would be prohibited from obtaining approval for our product for seven or more years, unless our product can be shown to be clinically superior. In addition, even if we obtain orphan exclusivity, the FDA may approve another product during our orphan exclusivity period for the same indication under certain circumstances. Additionally, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented through litigation, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension or our product candidates. US patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference or derivation proceedings, and US patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, reissue, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Our foreign patents have been and may be in the future subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application.

The Administration and the majority party in the Senate have indicated their ongoing desire to repeal the ACA and, in December 2017, Congress repealed the ACA's individual mandate, i.e., the penalty imposed on individuals who do not obtain health care coverage. It is unclear what the effect of this partial repeal will be and whether, when and how repeal of other sections of the law may be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector will be. In December 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas found the ACA to be unconstitutional, although the ruling was stayed while the case is appealed. It is unclear what the outcome of this litigation and other pending challenges to the ACA's constitutionality, as well as the effect of these matters on the healthcare sector, will be.

For instance, effective May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal data (generally, of EU residents), including its use, protection and the rights of affected persons regarding their data. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, several other jurisdictions around the world have recently enacted privacy laws or regulations similar to GDPR. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which is effective January 1, 2020 and which gives consumers many of the same rights as those available under GDPR. Several laws similar to the CCPA have been proposed in the United States at both the federal and state level. GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business. We are evaluating its processes and taking measures to ensure compliance with all applicable privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations.

On July 1, 2016, CMS implemented its first mandatory reporting period that required Skilled Nursing Facilities to submit information annually on staffing and census data on the Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) system. CMS has long identified staffing as one of the vital components of a skilled nursing facility's ability to provide quality care. The PBJ system allows staffing and census information to be easily collected by CMS.  The staffing information gathered is not consistent with the actual hours worked, but instead based upon an established set of regulations.

They include the rate of rehospitalization, emergency room use, community discharge, improvements in function, and independently worsened ability to move. In 2017, CMS issued a temporary freeze of the Health Inspection Five Star Ratings beginning in 2018 that is scheduled to end in the spring of 2019. The health inspection star rating for recertification surveys and complaints conducted on or after November 28, 2017 will be frozen. The freeze of the Health Inspection Five Star Ratings and the increase in the standards for performance on quality measures could reduce the number of our 4 and 5 star facilities. If we are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, our ability to attract and retain patients could be adversely affected. ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act) include sweeping changes to how health care is paid for and furnished in the United States.

Such results may not be statistically significant, have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny, and may not be indicative of the long-term future performance of treatment with our programs. If the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated or maintained over time, utilization of our programs could decline substantially. There are no standardized methods for measuring efficacy of programs such as ours. Even if we believe our solutions are effective, our customers could determine they are not utilizing different outcomes measures. In addition, even if our customers determine our solutions are effective they may discontinue them because they determine that the aggregate cost savings are not sufficient or that our programs do not have a high enough return on investment. Our success is dependent on our ability to enroll third-party payor members in our OnTrak solutions.

1136174,"In providing administrative services to healthcare providers and operating our treatment programs, we may collect, use, disclose, maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, including the administrative simplification requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH). The HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information (“Protected Health Information” or “PHI”), and requires safeguarding that information. The HIPAA Security Rule and HITECH establish elaborate requirements for safeguarding PHI transmitted or stored electronically. HIPAA applies to covered entities, which may include healthcare facilities and also includes health plans that will contract for the use of our programs and our services. HIPAA and HITECH require covered entities to bind contractors that use or disclose protected health information (or “Business Associates”) to compliance with certain aspects of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and all of the HIPAA Security Rule. In addition to contractual liability, Business Associates are also directly subject to regulation by the federal government. Direct liability means that we are subject to audit, investigation and enforcement by federal authorities. HITECH imposes new breach notification obligations requiring us to report breaches of “Unsecured Protected Health Information” or PHI that has not been encrypted or destroyed in accordance with federal standards. Business Associates must report such breaches so that their covered entity customers may in turn notify all affected patients, the federal government, and in some cases, local or national media outlets. We may be required to indemnify our covered entity customers for costs associated with breach notification and the mitigation of harm resulting from breaches that we cause. If we are providing management services that include electronic billing on behalf of a physician practice or facility that is a covered entity, we may be required to conduct those electronic transactions in accordance with the HIPAA regulations governing the form and format of those transactions. Services provided under our OnTrak solution not only require us to comply with HIPAA and HITECH but also Title 42 Part 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“Part 2”). Part 2 is a federal, criminal law that severely restricts our ability to use and disclose drug and alcohol treatment information obtained from federally-supported treatment facilities. Our operations must be carefully structured to avoid liability under this law. Our OnTrak solution qualifies as a federally funded treatment facility which requires us to disclose information on members only in compliance with Title 42. In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing the privacy and security of health and personal information. The penalties for violation of these laws vary widely and the area is rapidly evolving. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security laws and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal privacy and security laws could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including significant reputational damage associated with a breach. If regulations change or it is determined that we are not in compliance with privacy regulations we may be required to modify aspects of our program which may adversely affect program results and our business or profitability. Under HITECH, we are subject to prosecution or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH.",1.433033,19.248236,62,-5.57041681333333

There may be other unforeseen changes in technology which may have a significant impact on our business model. Our investment portfolio is subject to equity risk, which is the risk of loss due to deterioration in market value of public equity or alternative assets. We include public equity and alternative assets (including private equity, hedge funds and real estate) in our portfolio constructions, as these asset classes can provide returns over longer periods of time, aligning with the long-term nature of certain of our liabilities. Public equity and alternative assets have varying degrees of price transparency. Equities traded on stock exchanges (public equities) have significant price transparency, as transactions are often required to be disclosed publicly. Assets for which price transparency is more opaque include private equity (joint ventures/limited partnerships) and direct real estate. As these investments typically do not trade on public markets and indications of realizable market value may not be readily available, valuations can be infrequent and/or more volatile. A sustained decline in public equity and alternative markets may reduce the returns earned by our investment portfolio through lower than expected dividend income, property operating income, and capital gains, thereby adversely impacting earnings, capital, and product pricing assumptions.

1137774,"Our insurance and annuity products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are subject to interest rate risk, which is the risk of loss arising from asset/liability duration mismatches within our general account investments as well as invested assets of other entities and operations. The risk of mismatch in asset/liability duration is mainly driven by the specific dynamics of product liabilities. Some product liabilities are expected to have only modest risk related to interest rates because cash flows can be matched by available assets in the investable space. The interest rate risk emerges primarily from their tail cash flows (30 years or more), which cannot be matched by assets for sale in the marketplace, exposing the Company to future reinvestment risk. Market-sensitive cash flows exist with other product liabilities including products whose cash flows can be linked to market performance through secondary guarantees, minimum crediting rates, and/or changes in insurance assumptions.

These transactions expose the Company to counterparty risk. Counterparties include commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers and insurance and reinsurance companies.

Mortality risk is a biometric risk that can manifest in the following ways: Our significant business operations outside the U.S. subject us to foreign exchange risk, which is the risk of loss arising from assets that are invested in a different currency than the related liability, as well as the unhedged portion of the Company's earnings from, and capital supporting, operations in a foreign currency. As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside of the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these operations, as well as in our investment portfolio. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and cash flows, as well as increase the volatility of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP. In the short-term, solvency margins in our Japan businesses can also be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.",0.035835065,23.9648753333333,52,0.180314784111111
1137774,"Our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that an obligor (or guarantor) is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual payment obligations on its fixed maturity security, loan or other obligations. Credit risk may manifest in an idiosyncratic manner (i.e., specific to an individual borrower or industry) or through market-wide credit cycles. Financial deterioration of the obligor increases the risk of default and may increase the capital charges required under such regimes as the NAIC RBC, the FSA SMR or other constructs to hold the investment and in turn, potentially limit our overall capital flexibility. Credit defaults (as well as credit impairments, realized losses on credit-related sales, and increases in credit related reserves) may result in losses which adversely impact earnings, capital and our ability to appropriately match our liabilities and meet future obligations. Certain of our insurance products are subject to policyholder behavior risk, which is the risk that actual policyholder behavior deviates adversely from what is expected. Policyholder behavior risk includes the following components: We are subject to the risk that we may not adequately maintain information security.

We and our collaborators attempt to provide guidance as to the timing for the filing and acceptance of such regulatory approvals, but such filings and approvals may not occur when we or our collaborators expect, or at all. The FDA or other foreign regulatory agency may refuse or delay approval of our product candidates for failure to collect sufficient clinical or animal safety data and require us or our collaborators to conduct additional clinical or animal safety studies which may cause lengthy delays and increased costs to our programs. For example, the approval of Baxalta's HYQVIA BLA in the U.S. was delayed until we and Baxalta provided additional preclinical data sufficient to address concerns regarding non-neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 that were detected in the registration trial.

If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with the Company’s products, practitioner demand for its products could be inhibited, resulting in unfavorable operating results and reduced growth potential. The Company has entered into distribution arrangements pursuant to which the Company utilizes its sales force and distributors to sell products manufactured by other companies. In Japan, the Company has a non-exclusive right to distribute a Q-switched laser product manufactured by a third party OEM. The Company also has an exclusive agreement with ZO to distribute certain of their proprietary skincare products in Japan. Each of these agreements requires us to purchase annual minimum dollar amounts of their products. Additionally, the Company has entered into distribution arrangements with other companies to promote and sell the Secret RF and Juliet products. If the Company modifies one of its FDA-cleared devices, it may need to seek a new clearance, which, if not granted, would prevent the Company from selling its modified products or cause it to redesign its products. The search for a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), may cause uncertainty regarding the future of the Company’s business, impact employee hiring and retention, increase the volatility in our stock price, and adversely impact the Company’s revenue, operating results, and financial condition. For instance, on or about July 30, 2018, the FDA issued a public statement and sent letters to a number of companies in the medical aesthetics industry expressing concerns regarding “vaginal revitalization” procedures using energy-based devices.

Further, the Company has a relatively limited number of shares of common stock outstanding, a large portion of which is held by a small number of investors, which could result in the increase in volatility of its stock price. If the Company fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state agencies or international regulatory bodies and our commercial operations would be harmed. Demand for our products in any of the Company’s markets could be weakened by several factors, including: Economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory qualifications or approvals for its current or future products and indications, which could harm its business. From time to time the Company may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings, and as a result the Company may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that may negatively impact its operating results. The Company’s annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may cause the Company’s share price to decline. The Company's ability to access credit on favorable terms, if necessary, for the funding of our operations and capital projects may be limited due to changes in credit markets. To successfully market and sell our products internationally, the Company must address many issues that are unique to the Company's international business. Furthermore, international expansion is a key component of our growth strategy, although our international operations and foreign transactions expose us to additional operational challenges that the Company might not otherwise face.

Any defects in the design, material or workmanship of its products may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers, which could materially increase its expenses, adversely impact profitability and harm its business. The Company offers credit terms to some qualified customers and also to leasing companies to finance the purchase of its products. In the event that any of these customers default on the amounts payable to us, its earnings may be adversely affected. The Company’s ability to effectively compete and generate additional revenue from new and existing products depends upon the Company’s ability to distinguish the Company and its products from the competitors and their products, and to develop and effectively market new and existing products. The Company’s success is dependent on many factors, including the following: The aesthetic light and energy-based treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If the Company does not continue to innovate and develop new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications or enhancements to our current products. The Company created products to apply our technology to body contouring, hair removal, treatment of veins, tattoo removal, and skin revitalization, including the treatment of diffuse redness, skin laxity, fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, pore size and benign pigmented lesions, etc. For example, the Company introduced Juliet, a product for women’s intimate health, in December 2017, Secret RF, a fractional RF microneedling device for skin revitalization, in January 2018, enlighten SR in April 2018, and truSculpt iD in July 2018. To grow in the future, the Company must continue to develop and/or acquire new and innovative aesthetic products and applications, identify new markets, and successfully launch the newly acquired or developed product offerings.

Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Nevada, Ghana, Peru and Colorado. For example, pit failures at the Silverstar pit and Gold Quarry pit of the Carlin operation in 2018 and in the eastern wall of the open pit of the KCGM operation in 2018 resulted in temporary shutdowns and have impacted production.

Annually, the Company manages and places more than 100 million tonnes of tailings. Recognizing the importance of careful design, management and monitoring, Newmont conducts extensive siting, engineering, environmental and social studies to support the specific selection and design of each facility. Newmont's engineering, construction and operating standards and technical guidance explicitly cover tailings management and establish requirements throughout their operating and post-mine closure life. The design, construction and operation of all tailings impoundment facilities are scrutinized through our investment system process, supported by inspections and audits, critical controls and strict application of annual inspections by independent qualified geotechnical engineers. Newmont's environmental standards also cover the long-term management of tailings impoundment facilities. The failure of tailings dam and storage facilities and other impoundments at our mining sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review and enhance our existing practices. However, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future.

We generally are unable to control the amount of our assessments, and we may be required to pay higher FDIC assessments in the future than we currently do if increases are required to meet the FDIC's designated reserve ratio, or if there is an increase in the number of bank failures. In addition, CIT could be required to pay risk-based assessments to the Orderly Liquidation Fund if there are future liquidations of systemically important BHCs or non-bank financial companies.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject CIT or CIT Bank, as well as their officers and directors, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties. Regulators also have broad authority to enforce AML and sanctions laws. Failure to comply with AML and sanctions laws or to maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when considering approval of applications to acquire, merge, or consolidate with another banking institution, or to engage in other expansionary activities. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to AML and sanctions laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. Any violation of law or regulation, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations, could result in the fines, sanctions or other penalties described above, which could have significant reputational or other consequences and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

1175151,"In the U.S., even for companies that are not “covered entities” or business associates” under HIPAA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule. Some state privacy and security laws apply more broadly than HIPAA and associated regulations. For example, California recently enacted legislation – the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA – which goes into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA before it goes into effect, and the California Attorney General will issue clarifying regulations. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for certain information collected as part of clinical trials as specified in the law, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. It remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted.

We believe using both an immunohistochemistry-, or IHC-, based diagnostic and a circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, blood-based companion diagnostic to select patients with gastric and GEJ cancer whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b or amplify the FGFR2 gene should increase the likelihood of identifying eligible patients and the probability of success in our FIGHT trial. However, our selection criteria limit the overall number of patients eligible for enrollment in the trial. Also, if our assumptions regarding the percentage of patients with tumors that overexpress FGFR2b or amplify the FGFR2 gene that we expect to identify for inclusion in the FIGHT trial are higher than we actually observe, the FIGHT trial will take longer to enroll, we will incur higher costs and the commercial potential for bemarituzumab would be adversely affected. Additionally, Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, is conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials of its zolbetuximab (IMAB362, claudiximab) anti-Claudin 18.2 antibody in combination with mFOLFOX6 or capecitabine and oxaliplatin, or CAPOX, as front-line treatment in patients with HER2-negative, Claudin 18.2-positive gastric and GEJ cancer.

In the United States, in general, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to a legally marketed device, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or the grant of a de novo request under section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA or a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is ""substantially equivalent"" to a legally-marketed ""predicate"" device. To be ""substantially equivalent,"" the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics, not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device and be as safe and as effective as the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support a substantial equivalence determination. In the de novo process, a manufacturer whose novel device under the FDCA would otherwise be automatically classified as Class III and require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing is able to request down-classification of the device to Class I or II on the basis that the device presents a low or moderate risk. If the FDA grants the de novo petition, the applicant will receive authorization to market the device. This device type may be used subsequently as a predicate device for 510(k) submissions. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.

If our warrant and equity-related investments do not generate gains, then the return on our invested capital will be lower than it would otherwise be, which could result in a decline in the value of shares of our common stock. The 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have and may in the future choose to pay distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive. Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our investment portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution and could impair our ability to service our borrowings. An investment strategy focused on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. We may be unable to obtain debt capital on favorable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. In addition to regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to raise capital, our 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could require accelerated repayment under the facility or require us to repurchase the 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions. Our investments may be in portfolio companies that have limited operating histories and resources. We may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions. Depressed oil and natural gas prices for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on us. Our relationship with certain portfolio companies may expose us to our portfolio companies' trade secrets and confidential information which may require us to be parties to non-disclosure agreements and restrict us from engaging in certain transactions. Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with venture capital and private equity fund sponsors, and our inability to develop or maintain these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.",0.52746952,20.983748,52,-3.88979577
1281761,"From time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that will, effective January 1, 2020, substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard removes the existing ""probable"" threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this upcoming change to the allowance measurement and subsequent concerns related to the impact on capital and capital planning. The rule provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital impact upon adoption of the standard. The impact of this final rule on Regions and Regions Bank will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of the standard over a three-year period. The adoption of the standard may result in  an overall material increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the impact at adoption will be influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. It is also possible that Regions' ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption. As discussed in greater detail below, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, is effective January 1, 2020, and will substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. The standard removes the existing ""probable"" threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets.

In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cyber-attack or information security breach, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices may be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Regions' or our customers' confidential, proprietary and other information. We also have insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain losses associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses from any such attack or breach. Additionally, cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking or terrorist activities, could disrupt Regions' or our customers' or other third parties' business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including Regions. Although these past events have not resulted in a breach of Regions' client data or account information, such attacks have adversely affected the performance of Regions Bank's website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers from accessing Regions Bank's secure websites for consumer and commercial applications. In all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyber-attack or information security breach that impacts us. In addition, our third-party service providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems or, once identified, be unable to promptly provide required patches.  Further, even if provided, such patches may not fully remediate any vulnerability or may be difficult for Regions to implement.

In order for us to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year. To make sure that we will not fail to satisfy this requirement and for anti-takeover reasons, our declaration of trust generally prohibits any shareholder (other than an excepted holder or certain designated investment entities, as defined in our declaration of trust) from owning (actually, constructively or by attribution), more than 7% of the value or number of our outstanding common shares. Our declaration of trust provides an excepted holder limit that allows members of the Kite family (Al Kite, John Kite and Paul Kite, their family members and certain entities controlled by one or more of the Kites), as a group, to own more than 7% of our outstanding common shares, so long as, under the applicable tax attribution rules, no one excepted holder treated as an individual would hold more than 21.5% of our common shares, no two excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than 28.5% of our common shares, no three excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than 35.5% of our common shares, no four excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than 42.5% of our common shares, and no five excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than 49.5% of our common shares. Currently, one of the excepted holders would be attributed all of the common shares owned by each other excepted holder and, accordingly, the excepted holders as a group would not be allowed to own in excess of 21.5% of our common shares. If at a later time, there were not one excepted holder that would be attributed all of the shares owned by the excepted holders as a group, the excepted holder limit would not permit each excepted holder to own 21.5% of our common shares. Rather, the excepted holder limit would prevent two or more excepted holders who are treated as individuals under the applicable tax attribution rules from owning a higher percentage of our common shares than the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one excepted holder (21.5%), plus the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one or more other individual common shareholders who are not excepted holders (7%). Certain entities that are defined as designated investment entities in our declaration of trust, which generally include pension funds, mutual funds, and certain investment management companies, are permitted to own up to 9.8% of our outstanding common shares, so long as each beneficial owner of the shares owned by such designated investment entity would satisfy the 7% ownership limit if those beneficial owners owned directly their proportionate share of the common shares owned by the designated investment entity. Our Board of Trustees may waive, and has waived in the past, the 7% ownership limit or the 9.8% designated investment entity limit for a shareholder that is not an individual if such shareholder provides information and makes representations that are satisfactory to the Board of Trustees, in its reasonable discretion, to establish that such person's ownership in excess of the 7% limit or the 9.8% limit, as applicable, would not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. In addition, our declaration of trust contains certain other ownership restrictions intended to prevent us from earning income from related parties if such income would cause us to fail to comply with the REIT gross income requirements.

Our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or the removal of existing management and, as a result, could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and our Board of Trustees' power to reclassify shares and issue additional common shares or preferred shares and the absence of cumulative voting rights.

In addition, some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by a single supplier, including the magnets for our robotic magnetic system and certain components of our Odyssey Solution, and we generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. Our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks, including, among other things, the risk that: Our operating performance is dependent upon economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions and future global economic conditions may cause customers to delay purchasing or installation decisions or cancel existing orders. The Niobe ES system, Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system are typically purchased as part of a larger overall capital project and an economic downturn or the lack of a robust recovery might make it more difficult for our customers, including distributors, to obtain adequate financing to support the project or to obtain requisite approvals. Any delay in purchasing decisions or cancellation of purchasing commitments may result in a decrease in our revenues. A credit crisis could further affect our business if key suppliers are unable to obtain financing to manufacture our products or become insolvent and we are unable to manufacture product to meet customer demand. If the United States and global economy becomes sluggish or deteriorates for a longer period than we anticipate, we may experience a material negative decrease on the demand for our products which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition, ability to raise additional capital and the market price of our stock.",0.099529654,19.2048494444444,33,-4.4160547

The products we design may not satisfy all of the performance requirements of our customers and we may need to improve or modify the design or ask our subcontractors to modify their production process in order to do so. In addition, we or our subcontractors may experience quality problems, substantial costs and unexpected delays related to efforts to upgrade and expand manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities. If we incur delays due to quality problems or other unexpected events, our revenue may be impacted.

We continue to develop the Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system for interventional labs that have a robotic magnetic system installed as well as those standard interventional labs that do not have a robotic magnetic system installed. However, we have limited financial and managerial resources and, therefore, may be required to focus on products in selected industries and sites and to forego efforts with regard to other products and industries. Our decisions may not produce viable commercial products and may divert our resources from more profitable market opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to developing products in these additional areas but may be unable to justify the value proposition or otherwise develop a commercial market for products we develop in these areas, if any.

If we cannot obtain or maintain the desired licenses or rights for any of our products, we could be forced to try to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon the product altogether, which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations. If we have to abandon a product, our ability to develop and grow our business in new directions and markets would be adversely affected. If we do not maintain licenses or exclusivity with suppliers of certain components of our Odyssey Solution, competitors may enter the market, negatively impacting our ability to develop and commercialize the Odyssey Solution. We believe that physicians will not use our products unless they determine that the Niobe ES system and Vdrive system provide a safe, effective and preferable alternative to interventional methods in general use today. If longer-term patient studies or clinical experience indicate that treatment with our system or products is less effective, less efficient or less safe than our current data suggest, our sales would be harmed, and we could be subject to significant liability. Further, unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury could cause negative publicity for our products, particularly in the early phases of product introduction. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products if they perceive liability risks arising from the use of these new products. It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us and adversely affecting demand for our products. If physicians do not use our products, we likely will not become profitable or generate sufficient cash to survive as a going concern. The rate of innovation for the market in which our products compete is fast-paced and requires significant resources and innovation. If other products and technologies are developed that compete with, or may compete with, the Niobe, Odyssey and Vdrive systems, it could be difficult for us to maintain our advantages associated with being an early developer of this technology.

If the Company is not able to continue to commit sufficient resources to ensure that its products are compatible with other products within the electrophysiology lab, this could have a negative impact on revenue.",0.099529654,19.2048494444444,33,-4.4160547
1289340,"We anticipate that our robotic magnetic system will continue to have a lengthy sales cycle because it consists of a relatively expensive piece of capital equipment, the purchase of which requires the approval of senior management at hospitals, inclusion in the hospitals’ interventional lab budget process for capital expenditures, and, in some instances, a certificate of need from the state or other regulatory approval. In addition, historically the majority of our Niobe ES systems and Odyssey systems have been delivered less than one year after the receipt of a purchase order from a hospital, with the timing being dependent on the construction cycle for the new or replacement interventional suite in which the equipment will be installed. In some cases, this time frame has been extended further because the interventional suite construction is part of a larger construction project at the customer site (typically the construction of a new building), which may occur with our existing and future purchase orders. We cannot assure you that the time from purchase order to delivery for systems to be delivered in the future will be consistent with our historical experience. Moreover, a global economic slowdown may cause our customers to further delay construction or significant capital purchases, which could further lengthen our sales cycle. This may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease. To achieve and grow sales, hospitals must purchase our products, and in particular, our robotic magnetic system. The robotic magnetic system is a novel device, and hospitals and physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices. In addition, hospitals may delay their purchase or installation decision for the robotic magnetic system based on the disposable interventional devices that have received regulatory clearance or approval. Moreover, the robotic magnetic system is an expensive piece of capital equipment, representing a significant portion of the cost of a new or replacement interventional lab. Although priced significantly below a robotic magnetic system, the Odyssey Solution and Vdrive system are still expensive products. If hospitals do not widely adopt our systems, or if they decide that they are too expensive, we may never become profitable. Any failure to sell as many systems as our business plan requires could also have a seriously detrimental impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.

As a result of this limited availability, hospitals and other health care providers may be unable to obtain a certificate of need for the purchase of our systems. Further, our sales and installation cycle for the Niobe ES system is typically longer in certificate of need states due to the time it takes our customers to obtain the required approvals. In addition, our customers must meet various federal and state regulatory and/or accreditation requirements in order to receive payments from government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, receive full reimbursement from third party payors, and maintain their customers.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny. We face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. In previous clinical studies involving viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of leukemia due to vector-related insertional oncogenesis.  If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. Actual or potential sales of our common stock by our employees, including our executive officers, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.",0.11056174,21.9211847777778,32,2.57988633444444
1293971,"We face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. If our competitors obtain orphan drug exclusivity for products that regulatory authorities determine constitute the same drug and treat the same indications as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity. Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex parte reexaminations, post-grant review, and inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws.

1294133,"As of December 31, 2018, we have seven pending patent applications and one pending international patent application, thirty-three issued patents relating to the design and construction of our oxygen concentrators and our intelligent delivery technology. We cannot specify which of these patents individually or as a group will permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Patents may be subject to reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, and derivation proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or comparable proceedings in other patent offices worldwide. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices. Any of these proceedings could result in loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our protection. Interference, reexamination, inter partes review, defense, and opposition proceedings may be costly and time consuming, and we, or the other parties from whom we might potentially license intellectual property, may be unsuccessful in defending against such proceedings. Thus, any patents that we own or might license may provide limited or no protection against competitors. In addition, our pending patent applications and those we may file in the future may have claims narrowed during prosecution or may not result in patents being issued. Even if any of our pending or future applications are issued, they may not provide us with any competitive advantage or adequate protection from allegations of infringement, whether valid or frivolous, which may result in the incurrence of material defense costs. Our patents and patent applications are directed to particular aspects of our products. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods for oxygen therapy. If these developments were to occur, it would likely have an adverse effect on our sales. Our ability to develop additional patentable technology is also uncertain. We obtain some of the components, subassemblies and completed products included in our Inogen One systems and our Inogen At Home from a single source or a limited group of manufacturers or suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one or more of these manufacturers or suppliers could cause significant production delays, an inability to meet customer demand, substantial loss in revenue, and an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",0.015013224,20.6508052222222,33,0.418256098888889

Owning and operating cattle feeding operations involves numerous external factors that are outside of our control. The partnership may not have sufficient available cash to pay quarterly distributions on its units. Federal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions. International activities such as boycotts, embargoes, product rejection, trade policies and compliance matters, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. A majority of the executive officers and directors of the partnership are also officers of our company, which could result in conflicts of interest. Our ability to maintain the required regulatory permits or manage changes in environmental, safety and TTB regulations is essential to successfully operating our plants.",0.3646746,19.4701461111111,32,1.75632586555556

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial results. The unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or unfavorable determinations with respect to, government and economic incentives in the U.S. and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles, energy storage products or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services. We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musk's statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings. Our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand, including by expanding and optimizing our retail, service and vehicle charging operations, will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales, installations or servicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions. Our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications. Tesla is a highly-visible public company whose products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are often scrutinized by critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock. Our products and services are subject to substantial regulations, which are evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.

Our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns, which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions and the general level of economic activity. Our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our sales and quarterly financial performance, including: uncertain macro-economic conditions and changes in the retail sales environment; changes in our merchandising strategy; timing and concentration of new store openings and related start-up costs; expenses associated with new stores, our omni-channel strategy and marketing expenses; changes in our merchandise mix; changes in and regional variations in demographic and population characteristics; timing of promotional events; seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; and actions by our competitors. Accordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable sales for any particular future period may increase or decrease.

1323468,"The tax treatment of distributions on our Series A Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat each of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units as partners for tax purposes and will treat distributions on the Series A Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to each of the holders of Series A Preferred Units as ordinary income. Holders of our Series A Preferred Units will recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment (even in the absence of a contemporaneous cash distribution). Otherwise, except in the case of our liquidation, the holders of Series A Preferred Units are generally not anticipated to share in our items of income, gain, loss or deduction, nor will we allocate any share of our nonrecourse liabilities to the holders of Series A Preferred Units. If the Series A Preferred Units were treated as indebtedness for tax purposes, rather than as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, distributions likely would be treated as payments of interest by us to each of the holders of Series A Preferred Units. A holder of Series A Preferred Units will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale of Series A Preferred Units equal to the difference between the amount realized by such holder and such holder's tax basis in the Series A Preferred Units sold. The amount realized generally will equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property such holder receives in exchange for such Series A Preferred Units. Subject to general rules requiring a blended basis among multiple partnership interests, the tax basis of a Series A Preferred Units will generally equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property paid by the holder of such Series A Preferred Units to acquire such Series A Preferred Units. Gain or loss recognized by a holder of Series A Preferred Units on the sale or exchange of a Series A Preferred Unit held for more than one year generally will be taxable as long-term capital gain or loss. Because holders of Series A Preferred Units will generally not be allocated a share of our items of depreciation, depletion or amortization, it is not anticipated that such holders will be required to recharacterize any portion of their gain as ordinary income as a result of the recapture rules. Investment in the Series A Preferred Units by tax-exempt investors, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts, and non-United States persons raises issues unique to them.

Distributions to non-United States holders of Series A Preferred Units will be subject to withholding taxes. If the amount of withholding exceeds the amount of United States federal income tax due, non-United States holders of Series A Preferred Units may be required to file United States federal income tax returns in order to seek a refund of such excess. Although we expect that much of the income we earn is generally eligible for the 20% deduction for qualified publicly traded partnership income, it is uncertain whether a guaranteed payment for the use of capital may constitute an allocable or distributive share of such income. As a result, the guaranteed payment for use of capital received by our Series A Preferred Units may not be eligible for the 20% deduction for qualified publicly traded partnership income. We may not have sufficient cash from operations to enable us to pay distributions on our Series A Preferred Units or maintain distributions on our common units at current levels following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner.

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016 - 13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which -replaces the current ""incurred loss"" model for recognizing credit losses with an ""expected loss"" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the ""incurred loss"" model required under current U.S. GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses.

1333493,"To the extent that our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility or adverse outcomes as a result of tax examinations, our operating results could be harmed. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, relating to accounting for income taxes. In addition, GAAP applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or changes in tax legislation could adversely affect our results. In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas in Texas v. United States of America et al., determined that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, because it was not within Congress's tax power or interstate commerce power.  It also determined that the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act were inseverable and therefore invalid.  The court, however, did not rule that the operation of the Affordable Care Act be enjoined, so the law continues to operate until determined otherwise by the court or an appellate court.  If the Affordable Care Act were finally determined to be unconstitutional and no longer operated, it is unclear what impact it or its replacement would have on our business.  However, it or its replacement could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method, which required us to revise our historical financial information to be consistent with the new standard.  The adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  The most significant impact Acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results. The marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If our ability to enroll individuals during enrollment periods is impeded, our business will be harmed.",0.052672885,21.7775933333333,52,3.320118

We now recognize revenue for Medicare-related, individual and family and ancillary health insurance plan approved members based upon the total expected commissions we expect to receive over the life of the underlying polices, net of a constraint. We now recognize small business health insurance plan commission revenue at the time the application for the plan is approved by the carrier and when it renews each year thereafter, equal to the estimated commissions we expect to collect over the following 12-months. The constrained lifetime value for each product line is an estimate and is based on a number of assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, estimates of the conversion rates of approved members into paying members, forecasted member churn and forecasted commission amounts we expect to receive per approved member. These assumptions are based on historical trends and incorporate management's judgment. Changes in our historical trends will result in changes to our constrained lifetime value estimates in future periods and therefore could adversely affect our revenue and financial results in those future periods. As a result, negative changes in the factors upon which we estimate constrained lifetime values, such as reduced conversion of approved members to paying members, increased member churn or a reduction in the lifetime commission amounts we expect to receive for selling the plan to a member or other changes outside our control, would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we ultimately receive commission payments that are less than the amount we estimated when we recognized commission revenue, we would need to write-off of the remaining commission receivable balance, which would harm our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.",0.052672885,21.7775933333333,52,3.320118

We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, infringed or misused other parties' intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or that cover third-party technology that we use as a part of our websites. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights. We might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our services and may be unable to compete effectively.

Among these factors, the assumptions underlying our estimates of commission revenue as required by Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), may vary over time. We may state possible outcomes as high and low ranges. Any range we provide is not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors and we may decide to suspend guidance at any time. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.

Among these factors, the assumptions underlying our estimates of commission revenue as required by Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), may vary over time. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance, particularly in light of the fact that our business and industry are undergoing substantial change as a result of health care reform and initiatives we determined to pursue. If our revenue or operating results differ from our guidance or fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. In the past, when our revenue and operating results differed from our guidance and the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock was impacted.",0.052672885,21.7775933333333,52,3.320118

There have been instances where we have determined that policy cancellation data reported to us by a health insurance carrier has not been accurate. The extent to which health insurance carriers are inaccurate in their reporting of policy cancellations could cause us to change our cancellation estimates, which could adversely impact our revenues. We apply judgment and make estimates based on historical data and current trends to independently determine whether or not carriers are accurately reporting commissions due to us.

Prospectively, to the extent that health insurance carriers understate or fail to accurately report the amount of commissions due to us in a timely manner or at all, our estimates of constrained lifetime value may be adversely impacted, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

The loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our businesses and achieve our business plan, which could cause our sales to decline and our operating results and cash flows to suffer. We do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to implement and support information technology improvements or respond to technological changes, our growth, prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected. We face periodic reviews and billing audits from governmental and private payors and these audits could have adverse results that may negatively impact our business. State licensure laws for DME suppliers are subject to change. If we fail to comply with any state laws, we will be unable to operate as a DME supplier in such state and our business operations will be adversely affected.

If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Covenants in our current and any future debt agreement restrict our business. Our business has and may continue to be adversely impacted by the U.S. federal government’s sequestration. Our business is substantially dependent on estimates of collectible revenue from third-party reimbursement. The industry in which we operate is intensely competitive and ever-changing. If we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors, our business operations may suffer. Restricted stock awards and the exercise of stock options may depress our stock price and may result in dilution to our common stockholders.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time. If automobile manufacturers and other industry groups express reservations regarding the use of biodiesel, our ability to sell biodiesel will be negatively impacted. We may be unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions with our operations or realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Risks Associated with Our Business Activities Fluctuations in commodity prices may cause a reduction in the demand or profitability of the products or services we produce. Growth in the sale and distribution of biodiesel is dependent on the expansion of related infrastructure which may not occur on a timely basis, if at all, and our operations could be adversely affected by infrastructure limitations or disruptions.

The determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Pension plan assets primarily consist of equity and fixed income investments, therefore fluctuations in actual equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase future pension costs. Changes in any of these factors may significantly impact future contribution requirements.

In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends. For additional details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to Brexit and European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies.

1341439,"Adverse litigation results could affect our business.     We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management's attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.     We continue to make strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.    In fiscal 2019, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares.

We face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection or other product candidates that we may develop and may have to limit their commercialization. Risks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Even if one of our CR845/difelikefalin-based product candidates receives regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products. The FDA may determine that I.V. CR845/difelikefalin, or any of our other product candidates, has undesirable side effects that could limit dosage in development, delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization. Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products that we commercialize, including services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize I.V.

1347178,"Even where laws provide protection or we are able to obtain patents, costly and time-consuming litigation may be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. Moreover, any actions we may bring to enforce our intellectual property against our competitors could provoke them to bring counterclaims against us, and some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios than we have. To counter infringement or unauthorized use of any patents we may obtain, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate. In addition, if we or one of our future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products, current product candidates, or one of our future products, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace and challenges to validity of patents in certain foreign jurisdictions are common as well. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. We may assert the patents in Hatch-Waxman litigation against the party filing the ANDA to keep the competing product off of the market until the patents expire but there is a risk that we will not succeed. The party filing the ANDA may also counterclaim in the litigation that our patents are not valid or unenforceable, and the court may find one or more claims of our patents invalid or unenforceable. If this occurs, a competing generic product could be marketed prior to expiration of our patents listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the ""Orange Book,"" which would harm our business. E.U. Member States tend to impose strict price controls, which may delay or prevent the further commercial launch or impede the commercial success of HETLIOZ® in Europe and adversely affect our future results of operations.",0.030185139,20.1078952222222,32,0.232765794444444
1347178,"On February 5, 2019, we filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the FDA's legal authority to issue the PCH, and seeking an order to set it aside. On February 14, 2019, the FDA filed a Motion for Voluntary Remand to the Agency and for a Stay of the Case. We intend to continue vigorously pursuing our interests in the matter (see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information). We are dependent on the commercial success of HETLIOZ® and Fanapt®. Growth of HETLIOZ® and Fanapt® may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons including competing products or unanticipated safety issues. If either HETLIOZ® or Fanapt® is not successful in gaining broad commercial acceptance, our business would be harmed. We rely on a limited number of specialty pharmacies for distribution of HETLIOZ® in the U.S., and the loss of one or more of these specialty pharmacies or their failure to distribute HETLIOZ® effectively would materially harm our business. Our revenues from Fanapt® are substantially dependent on sales through a limited number of wholesalers, and such revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties If we fail to establish or maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and we expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products at an acceptable cost and quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.

Kempton). The California Supreme Court ruled in favor of Caltrans, concluding that Caltrans may hire private contractors to perform architectural and engineering services on public works. Although Caltrans was successful in this litigation, similar claims may be brought in the future and we cannot predict their outcome. If a state or other public employee union is successful in its challenge and as a result the ability of state agencies to hire private firms is severely limited, such a decision would likely lead to additional litigation challenging the ability of the state, counties, municipalities and other public agencies to hire private engineering, architectural and other firms, the outcome of which could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

1382101,"Moreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. In addition, CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, beginning in 2018, CMS will pay for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. Further, on March 16, 2018, CMS finalized its National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for certain diagnostic laboratory tests using next generation sequencing that are approved by the FDA as a companion in vitro diagnostic and used in a cancer with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic indication. Under the NCD, diagnostic tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage and be available for patients with recurrent, metastatic relapsed, refractory or stages III and IV cancer. Additionally, the NCD extended coverage to repeat testing when the patient has a new primary diagnosis of cancer.

There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. There are many issued and pending patents that might claim aspects of our product candidates and modifications that we may need to apply to our product candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim antibodies, portions of antibodies, cytokines, half-life extending polymers, linkers, cytotoxins, or other warheads that may be relevant for the products we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license.

Additionally, with respect to certain of our multi-year orders in which fees increase from year to year, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (Topic 606) may require that the total contracted revenue for the entire multi-year term of the order be recognized ratably in the same amount in each year. As a result, in the initial year of such orders, we will recognize more revenue than the fees we invoice for the same period, and in the last year of such orders, we will recognize less revenue than the fees we invoice for the same period. This treatment may make our reported results less indicative of the actual health of our business at the time revenue is reported and may expose us to impaired accounts receivables or impaired unbilled accounts receivable if, for example, a customer terminated an otherwise non-cancelable multi-year contract for cause. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the stock price of our Class A common stock to decline. Deferred revenue and change in deferred revenue may not be an accurate indicator of our future financial results. Because we recognize subscription services revenues ratably over the term of the order for our subscription services, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial performance. The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain individuals and their affiliates, which will limit or preclude the ability of our investors to influence corporate matters and could depress the market value of our Class A common stock.

We could be subject to increases in insurance premiums, property or other taxes, repair and maintenance costs, payroll, utility costs, workers compensation, and other operating expenses due to various factors such as inflation, labor shortages, commodity and energy price increases, weather, increases to minimum wage rates, changes to governmental safety and real estate use limitations, ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors We may incur significant liabilities from environmental contamination or moisture infiltration.   Existing or future laws impose or may impose liability on us to clean up environmental contamination on or around properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, even if we were not responsible for or aware of the environmental contamination or even if such environmental contamination occurred prior to our involvement with the property.  We have conducted preliminary environmental assessments on most of our properties, which have not identified material liabilities.  These assessments, commonly referred to as ""Phase 1 Environmental Assessments,"" include an investigation (excluding soil or groundwater sampling or analysis) and a review of publicly available information regarding the site and other nearby properties. The acquisition of existing properties is subject to risks that may adversely affect our growth and financial results.    We have acquired self-storage facilities from third parties in the past, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.    We face significant competition for suitable acquisition properties from other real estate investors.

There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries.  We may become party to, or threatened with, infringement litigation claims regarding our products and technology, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect.  Moreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties.  Such proceedings could also include contested post-grant proceedings such as oppositions, inter partes review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or foreign patent offices.  The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings is low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated and require significant resources to defend.  Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensor can.  The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our products or product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company.  Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.  We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our products or product candidates and their uses, or we may incorrectly determine that a patent is invalid or does not cover a particular product or product candidate.

1393726,"Our insurance business is dependent on financial institutions, lenders and retailers to distribute its products and services and its revenue is dependent on the level of business conducted by such distributors as well as the effectiveness of their sales efforts, each of which is beyond our insurance business's control because such distributors typically do not have any minimum performance or sales requirements. Further, although its contracts with these distributors are typically exclusive, they can be canceled on relatively short notice. Therefore, our insurance business's growth is dependent, in part, on its ability to identify and attract new distribution relationships and successfully implement its information systems with those of its new distributors. The impairment of our insurance business's distribution relationships, the loss of a significant number of its distribution relationships, the failure to establish new distribution relationships, the failure to offer increasingly competitive products, the increase in sales of competitors' services and products by these distributors or the decline in their overall business activity or the effectiveness of their sales of our insurance business's products could materially reduce our insurance business's sales and revenues and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our Company. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are dependent upon receiving a sufficient number of total loss vehicles to sustain profit margins in our salvage auction business. Factors that can adversely affect the number of vehicles received include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the number of vehicles in operation or miles driven, mild weather conditions that cause fewer traffic accidents, reduction of policy writing by insurance providers that would affect the number of claims over a period of time, changes in vehicle technology and autonomous vehicles, a decrease in the percentage of claims resulting in a total loss or elimination of automotive collision coverage by consumers, delays or changes in state title processing, government regulations on the standards for producing vehicles and changes in direct repair procedures that would reduce the number of newer, less damaged total loss vehicles, which tend to have higher salvage values. In addition, our salvage auction business depends on a limited number of automobile insurance companies to supply the salvage vehicles we sell at auction. Our agreements with these insurance company suppliers are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these suppliers. Future decreases in the quality and quantity of vehicle inventory, and in particular the availability of newer and less damaged vehicles, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If the supply or value of salvage vehicles coming to auction declines significantly, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, decreases in commodity prices, such as steel and platinum, may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at salvage auctions.",0.57305658,21.5427257777778,56,-2.28029071066667
1396009,"The expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations  -  Recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates. Our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure  -   Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments. In 2018, voters in local jurisdictions in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, among others, approved bond and revenue-raising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects. In 2017, three state legislatures in Vulcan-served areas  -  California, South Carolina and Tennessee  -  passed new long-term highway funding legislation. In 2016, three states saw one-time revenue increases for transportation, and numerous ballot measures were passed to increase investment in several Vulcan-served areas including northern and southern California, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The federal FAST Act, a five year, fully-funded road, bridge and public transportation authorization law, is providing assistance to state DOTs and metro areas. However, given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects. Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments  -  Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments. We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business  -  We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). We face political and other risks associated with our international operations, including our largest production facility located in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. These risks may include changes in international trade policies, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties, arbitrary changes to permits, zoning classifications or operating agreements, or overt acts by foreign governments, including expropriations and other forms of takings of property. In addition, failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us.",0.30072451,23.4178344444444,21,-2.87920281888889
1396009,"Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures   -  Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities, taxes or tariffs on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, create restrictions on our products or impede our access to reserves or opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities. We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results   -  As discussed more fully in ""Critical Accounting Policies"" under Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" we use significant judgment in accounting for: A deterioration in our credit ratings and/or the state of the capital markets could negatively impact our business  -   We currently have $2.8 billion of debt with maturities between 2019 and 2048. Given our current credit metrics and ratings, together with other factors, we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due. Furthermore, we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations, additional debt and/or additional equity. The mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent. Disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations  -  Labor unions represent approximately 11% of our workforce. Disputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs and/or reduced revenues resulting in lower earnings. Weather can materially affect our operating results   -  Almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers' short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather.",0.30072451,23.4178344444444,21,-2.87920281888889
1396009,"Our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits  -  As a result of recent acquisitions, we operate construction paving businesses in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas. In some instances, including many of our fixed price paving contracts, we agree to complete a project by a certain date. If we fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay. Consequently, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project. Our long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings  -  Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry sites often take years to develop; therefore, our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites. Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations  -  A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.",0.30072451,23.4178344444444,21,-2.87920281888889

While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 2018 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units.

However, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.

As a result of these factors, the large capital investment required in purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles of our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly and be up to 12 months or longer. With the introduction of our nCounter SPRINT system in July 2015, which is targeted at individual researchers that often have less certain funding than other potential customers, our visibility regarding timing of sales has decreased. Given the length and uncertainty of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, fluctuations in our instrument sales on a period-to-period basis.

1401708,"In addition, the success of the development programs for any product candidates or assays developed in collaboration with others will be dependent on the continued pursuit and success of the related drug trials by our collaborators. For example, in October 2017, Merck notified us of their decision not to continue to pursue regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic we were developing for their product, KEYTRUDA, and in August 2018, we and Merck agreed to mutually terminate our development collaboration agreement. There is no guarantee that our collaborators will continue to pursue clinical trials for product candidates or assays that are the subject of our collaborations or that such clinical trials will be successful and, as a result, we may expend considerable time and resources developing in vitro diagnostic assays that will not gain regulatory approval. For example, pursuant to our collaboration with Celgene Corporation, we are developing a companion diagnostic, LymphMark, that is expected to be a potential companion diagnostic to aid in identifying patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for treatment. Depending on the outcome of the clinical trial being run by Celgene, we anticipate we may file for regulatory approval of LymphMark with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Furthermore, significant consolidation in the life sciences industry has occurred during the last several years and in connection with such consolidation, the combined company often reassesses its development priorities which may impact our existing collaborations or future opportunities. For example, in May 2017, Astellas Pharma announced a joint decision with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, to discontinue the planned ENDEAR trial which was the subject of our collaboration. We were informed that the decision resulted from an oncology portfolio review by Astellas Pharma and Pfizer. In January 2019, Bristol Myers Squibb announced that it was acquiring Celgene; this transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019. Even if we establish new relationships, we or our collaborators may terminate those relationships or they may never result in the successful development or commercialization of future tests or other products. From time to time we have agreed to modify the terms of our agreements with collaborators, including financial terms, and in the future it is possible that we will agree to modify the terms of existing and future agreements with collaborators.",0.43535423,20.7487478888889,32,-0.557353184444444
1401708,"We rely on Precision System Science, Co., Ltd of Chiba, Japan, to build our nCounter Prep Station, Korvis LLC of Corvallis, Oregon, to build our nCounter Digital Analyzer and GeoMx DSP, Paramit Corporation of Morgan Hill, California, to build our new nCounter SPRINT Profiler and IDEX Corporation of Lake Forest, Illinois to build the fluidics cartridge, a key component of our nCounter SPRINT Profiler. Each of these contract manufacturers are sole suppliers. Since our contracts with these instrument suppliers do not commit them to carry inventory or make available any particular quantities, they may give other customers' needs higher priority than ours, and we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. We also rely on sole suppliers for various components we use to manufacture our consumable products. We periodically forecast our needs for such components and enter into standard purchase orders with them. If we were to lose such suppliers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the quality and quantity of materials we require for our products, our supply chain would be interrupted which would adversely affect sales. If any of these events occur, our business and operating results could be harmed. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the section of this report captioned ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

1401708,"Certain of our products are regulated as in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including Prosigna and the nCounter FLEX Analysis System. Accordingly, we and certain of our contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, as well as regulation by the FDA and other national health authorities. These may include routine inspections by Notified Bodies, FDA, and other health authorities, of our manufacturing facilities and our records for compliance with requirements such as ISO 13485 and the QSR, which establish extensive requirements for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing and change control procedures. We are also subject to other regulatory obligations, such as requirements pertaining to the registration of our manufacturing facilities and the listing of our devices with the FDA; continued adverse event and malfunction reporting; reporting certain corrections and removals; and labeling and promotional requirements. Other agencies may also issue guidelines and regulations that could impact the development of our products, including companion diagnostic tests. For example, the European Medicines Agency, a European Union agency which is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines used in the EU, recently launched an initiative to determine guidelines for the use of genomic biomarkers in the development and life-cycle of drugs. On May 25, 2017 the European Union adopted the IVD Directive Regulation, which increases the regulatory requirements applicable to some in vitro diagnostics in",0.43535423,20.7487478888889,32,-0.557353184444444
1401708,"Any 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization or PMA approval we obtain for any future product would place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or sold. The FDA will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products, including, but not limited to, the obligation to comply with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, registering manufacturing facilities, listing the products with the FDA, and complying with labeling, marketing, complaint handling, medical device reporting requirements, and reporting certain corrections and removals. Obtaining FDA clearance or approval for diagnostics can be expensive and uncertain, and generally takes from several months to several years from submission, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data, as well as compliance with FDA regulations. In addition, we have limited experience in obtaining PMA approval from the FDA and are therefore supplementing our operational capabilities to manage the more complex processes needed to obtain and maintain PMAs. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA approval, de novo authorizations, or 510(k) clearance. Even if we were to obtain regulatory approval, authorization or clearance, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not market our product for those uses. The development of new products typically requires new scientific discoveries or advancements and complex technology and engineering. Such developments may involve external suppliers and service providers, making the management of development projects complex and subject to risks and uncertainties regarding timing, timely delivery of required components or services and satisfactory technical performance of such components or assembled products. For example, in 2017, we continued to work with our supplier of cartridges used in our nCounter SPRINT systems to improve the design which resolved the previous leakage issues in the microfluidic device produced for us. If we do not achieve the required technical specifications or successfully manage new product development processes, or if development work is not performed according to schedule, then such new technologies or products may be adversely impacted and our business and operating results may be harmed.",0.43535423,20.7487478888889,32,-0.557353184444444
1403161,"We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results. We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UK's HM Revenue & Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, or changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Program of Work, related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and global base-erosion proposal, may also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. See Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, licensing requirements, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities.",0.23050955,26.4175752222222,52,-0.749719149
1403161,"We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See Note 11 - Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business. A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business. Holders of our class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions. Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1. Business  - Government Regulation for more information. In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues.",0.23050955,26.4175752222222,52,-0.749719149

Failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth. We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management. We face intense competition in our industry. For certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 5 - U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20 - Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity. Government-imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia. We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws.

Details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 20 - Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive, and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages, or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements, or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, investigators, governments, or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to additional actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant. Merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business. We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place. Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain. We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties.

See Note 16, ""Litigation,"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.  Our current legal proceedings and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party are and will likely be expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend and resolve, and will divert our management's attention.  Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If the VorTeq Licensee fails to adopt the VorTeq, for any reason, we may not receive royalty payments or be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq. Our diversification into new fluid flow markets, such as oil & gas, may not be successful Parts of our inventory may become excess or obsolete, which would increase our cost of revenues. We are currently involved in legal proceedings, and may be subject to additional future legal proceedings, that may result in material adverse outcomes. Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries, as well as U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.S. export control laws.

1423689,"We measure the fair value of our investments in accordance with guidance set forth in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  Fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold since market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller.  Our determination of the fair value of our investments includes inputs provided by third-party dealers and pricing services. Valuations of certain investments in which we invest may be difficult to obtain or unreliable. In general, dealers and pricing services heavily disclaim their valuations and we do not have recourse against them due to liabilities and other damages arising from inaccurate price quotes or other inputs used to determine the fair value of our investments.  Depending on the complexity and illiquidity of a security, valuations of the same security can vary substantially from one dealer or pricing service to another.  Moreover, fair value and estimates of fair value may fluctuate over short periods of time.  For these reasons, the fair value at which our investments are recorded may not be an indication of their realizable value.  Furthermore, the ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control.  Consequently, if we were to liquidate an asset, particularly in a forced liquidation, the realized value may be less than the amount at which the asset is recorded, which would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.",0.79066521,22.8285564444444,52,-3.06427993555556
1423689,"From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our reported income prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Differences in the timing of the recognition of taxable income and deductible expenses and the actual receipt or disbursement of cash may also occur.  For example, if we purchase mortgage securities at issuance with a discount, we are generally required to accrete the discount into taxable income prior to receiving the cash proceeds.  In addition, we generally will be required to take certain amounts into income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. The application of this rule may require the accrual of, among other categories of income, income with respect to certain debt instruments or mortgage-backed securities, such as original issue discount or market discount, earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules, although the precise application of this rule is unclear at this time.  This rule generally is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 or, for debt instruments or mortgage-backed securities issued with original issue discount, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2018.  Moreover, we are not allowed to reduce our taxable income for a net capital loss incurred; instead, the net capital loss may be carried forward for a period of up to five years and applied against future capital gains subject to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains, which cannot be assured.  If we do not have funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell investments at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to maintain our qualification as a REIT or avoid corporate income tax and the 4% annual excise tax.

For example, Zuora CPQ integrates with certain capabilities of Salesforce using publicly available APIs. In general, we rely on the fact that the providers of such software systems, including Salesforce, continue to allow us access to their APIs to enable these integrations. To date, we have not relied on a long-term written contract to govern our integration relationship with Salesforce. Instead, we are subject to the standard terms and conditions for application developers of Salesforce, which govern the distribution, operation, and fees of applications on the Salesforce platform, and which are subject to change by Salesforce from time to time.

As such, the continued growth in market demand for these products is critical to our success. Demand for our solution is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the growth or contraction of the Subscription Economy, continued market acceptance of our solution by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products and services, features, and functionality introduced by our competitors, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles that would impact the functionality and use of our solution, and technological change. We expect that an increasing transition to disaggregated solutions that focus on addressing specific customer use cases would continue to disrupt the enterprise software space, enabling new competitors to emerge. We cannot assure you that our solutions and future enhancements to our solution will be able to address future advances in technology or the requirements of enterprise customers. If we are unable to meet customer demands in creating a flexible solution designed to address all these needs or otherwise achieve more widespread market acceptance of our solution, our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects would be adversely affected. Our future revenue growth also depends upon expanding sales and renewals of subscriptions to our solution with existing customers. If our existing customers do not expand their use of our solution over time or do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline.  We plan to continue expanding our sales efforts, both domestically and internationally, but we may be unable to hire qualified sales personnel, may be unable to successfully train those sales personnel that we are able to hire, and sales personnel may not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected or at all.

We have directed, and intend to continue to direct, a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to develop and grow Zuora RevPro. The market for Zuora RevPro is rapidly evolving as a result of the effectiveness of ASC 606, the revenue recognition accounting standard that took effect for most public companies in January 2018. While we have seen a significant number of Zuora RevPro deployments associated with the effectiveness of ASC 606, it is uncertain whether Zuora RevPro will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.

Non-qualified residential mortgage loans are considered less liquid than qualified residential mortgage loans because such loans cannot be securitized and can only be sold directly to other financial institutions. Such non-qualified residential mortgage loans may be considered riskier than qualified mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2018, our residential property loan portfolio amounted to $233.8 million or 17.5% of our total loans held-for-investment portfolio. As of such date, all of our residential property loans consisted of non-qualified residential mortgage loans. Non-qualified loans are residential loans that do not comply with certain standards set by the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations.

OREO typically consists of properties that we obtain through foreclosure or through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of an outstanding loan. OREO properties are valued on our books at the lesser of the recorded investment in the loan for which the property previously served as collateral or the property's fair value, which represents the estimated sales price of the property on the date acquired less estimated selling costs. Generally, in determining fair value, an orderly disposition of the property is assumed, unless a different disposition strategy is expected. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of OREO property, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.

As discussed in WES's Relationship with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K, we believe that one of our principal strengths is our and WES's relationship with Anadarko, and that Anadarko, through its significant indirect economic interest in us and WES, will continue to be motivated to promote and support the successful execution of WES's business plan and to pursue projects that help to enhance the value of WES's business. In 2014, Anadarko began monetizing a portion of its investment in us, including the sale of an aggregate of 28.8 million WGP common units. To the extent Anadarko's net interest in WES continues to decline through the sale of its WGP holdings or otherwise, Anadarko may be less incentivized to grow WES's business by offering WES assets or commercial arrangements. Accordingly, a decrease in Anadarko's net holdings in us or WES could have a material adverse effect on WES's business, results of operations, financial position and ability to grow or make cash distributions to WES's unitholders.

FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Accordingly, action by FERC could adversely affect our ability to establish reasonable rates that cover operating costs and allow for a reasonable return. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution. For example, one such matter relates to FERC's policy regarding allowances for income taxes in determining a regulated entity's cost of service. FERC's Revised Policy Statement established that FERC will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates and noted that to the extent an entity does not include an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates, such entity may elect to also exclude the accumulated deferred income tax balance from the rate calculation.

Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain.

1434418,"Risks Related to Our Common Stock Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. Any future indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. Our internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. We are currently pursuing the development of our product candidates in combination with other approved therapeutics. If the FDA revokes approval of any such therapeutic, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues arise with any therapeutic that we use in combination with one of our product candidates in the future, we may be unable to further develop and/or market our product candidate or we may experience significant regulatory delays or supply shortages, and our business could be materially harmed. Our certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors, officers and employees. Even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business. We are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the United States or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. If we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.",0.10263072,20.9989315555556,32,7.20597794444444
1434418,"In July 2014, the FDA issued final guidance that stated that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic unless the FDA approves or clears this ""in vitro companion diagnostic device"" at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic. We may be required by FDA to develop companion diagnostics to identify patients who are likely to benefit from our therapeutic product candidates. We expect to rely on third parties for much of the development, testing and manufacturing of such diagnostics. We will likely rely on such third parties to also obtain any required regulatory approval for and then commercially supply such diagnostics. We have very limited experience in the development of diagnostics and, even with the help of third parties with greater experience, may fail to obtain the required diagnostic product marketing approval, which could prevent or delay approval of the therapeutic product. Because we expect to rely on third parties for various aspects of the development, testing and manufacture, as well as for regulatory approval for and commercial supply, of our diagnostics, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require a diagnostic will be tied to and dependent on the continued ability of such third parties to make the diagnostic commercially available on reasonable terms in the relevant geographies. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. A significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.

Upon the consummation of the Transaction with GCU on July 1, 2018 (as discussed in ""Part I. Business - The Transaction""), we became a third party provider of education services to GCU, our only university client during 2018. On January 22, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Orbis Education, an educational services company that supports healthcare education programs for 17 universities across the United States.  See Note 14  -  Subsequent Event to consolidated financial statements.  While we currently provide services to 18 university clients across the United States, GCU is, and will for the foreseeable future remain, our most significant client.  Given that our revenue from operations during 2018 was derived entirely from GCU, and that our revenue from operations will continue to be derived substantially from our contractual relationship with GCU for the foreseeable future, the risk factors set forth below include risks attributable to GCU operating as a non-profit university, which could materially affect us.

While tenapanor met the primary endpoint in two Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating tenapanor for the treatment of patients with IBS-C, there can be no assurance that we will receive marketing authorization from FDA. In addition, a prolonged government shutdown may cause significant regulatory delays, and therefore, delay our efforts to seek and obtain approvals from the FDA, including approval of our NDA for tenapanor for the treatment of IBS-C.  Although tenapanor met the primary endpoint in the first Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis, there can be no assurances that the second Phase 3 trial of tenapanor in this indication will achieve the primary endpoint, or that our ongoing clinical trial evaluating tenapanor as adjuvant therapy to phosphate binders will achieve the primary endpoint.  There can be no assurances that we will receive regulatory approval to market tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis, either as monotherapy or as adjuvant therapy to phosphate binders. Further, it may not be possible or practicable to demonstrate, or if approved, to market tenapanor on the basis of certain of the benefits we believe tenapanor possesses. If the number of patients in the market for tenapanor or the price that the market can bear is not as significant as we estimate, or if we are not able to secure adequate coverage and reimbursement for tenapanor, we may not generate sufficient revenue from sales of tenapanor, if approved.

The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record non-cash interest expense through the amortization of the excess of the face amount over the carrying amount of the expected life of the Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's cash coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.",0.37234172,21.7916066666667,51,3.81016684555556

A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, on January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"" which changed our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition and incremental costs to acquire contracts. We also adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported to reflect the adoption. Certain other standards that become effective in the future may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial information for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors' confidence in us. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period's accretion of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.",0.3887167,22.7905884444444,51,1.90434114444444

Our business practices and the practices of issuing banks, including the terms of products, servicing and collection practices, are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities. These reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries. If as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we or issuing banks are not complying with applicable law, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices, changes in the terms of products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected consumers. They also could require us or issuing banks to stop offering some credit products or obtain licenses to do so, either nationally or in selected states. To the extent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks that originate credit products using our platform, under certain circumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks.

Unlike equity securities, bonds or other exchange-traded instruments with highly liquid markets, the ability to quickly sell certain of our target assets, such as certain securities and MSR, may be constrained by a number of factors, including a small number of willing buyers, lack of transparency as to current market terms and price, and time delays resulting from the buyer's desire to conduct due diligence on the assets, negotiation of a purchase and sale agreement, compliance with any applicable contractual or regulatory requirements, and for certain assets like MSR, the need for certain approvals from the investor in the underlying mortgage loan (e.g., Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac), all of which can result in a sale process that takes several weeks or months. Moreover, certain of our assets may not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in prohibitions against their transfer, sale, pledge or their disposition except in transactions that are exempt from registration requirements or are otherwise in accordance with such laws. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for certain of our securities and MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to sell such assets in a timely manner if the need or desire arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may be forced to sell our assets at a price that is significantly less than the value at which we previously attributed to such assets. Some of the assets in our portfolio are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other assets that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these assets quarterly at fair value, as determined in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which may include unobservable inputs. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed.

Any such waiver could be conditioned on an amendment to the lending agreement and any related guaranty agreement on terms that may be unfavorable to us.

The lenders are obligated to resell the same assets back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement. Because the cash that we receive from the lender when we initially sell the assets to the lender is less than the value of those assets (the difference being the ""haircut""), if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same assets back to us, we would incur a loss on the repurchase agreement equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). We would also incur losses on a repurchase agreement if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of the repurchase agreement term, because we would have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive assets worth less than that amount. Further, if we default on our obligations under a repurchase agreement, the lender will be able to terminate the repurchase agreement and cease entering into any other repurchase agreements with us. Typically, our repurchase agreements contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any repurchase agreement, lenders can also declare a default with respect to all other repurchase agreements. If a default occurs under any of our repurchase agreements and a lender terminates one or more of its repurchase agreements, we may need to enter into replacement repurchase agreements with different lenders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement repurchase agreements on the same terms as the repurchase agreements that were terminated or at all.

We may be required at times to adopt less efficient methods of financing certain of our mortgage related investments and we may be precluded from acquiring certain types of higher yielding securities. The net effect of these factors would be to lower our net interest income. If we fail to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced. Further, if the SEC determined that we were an unregistered investment company, we could be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC, we would potentially be unable to enforce contracts with third parties which could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period for which it was established we were an unregistered investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company, it would result in a change of our financial statement requirements. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to qualify for this exemption from regulation pursuant to the 1940 Act.

Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non - accretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income.

References to the Company's investment bank business include Cowen and Company, ATM Execution, Cowen Execution, Cowen Execution Services Limited, Cowen International Limited, Westminster and Cowen Prime. The Company may enter into large transactions in which it commits its own capital as part of its trading business to facilitate client trading activities. The number and size of these large transactions may materially affect the Company's results of operations in a given period. Market fluctuations may also cause the Company to incur significant losses from its trading activities. To the extent that the Company owns assets (i.e., has long positions), a downturn in the value of those assets or in the markets in which those assets are traded could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent that the Company has sold assets it does not own (i.e., has short positions), in any of those markets, an upturn in the value of those assets or in markets in which those assets are traded could expose the Company's investment bank business to potentially large losses as it attempts to cover short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market.

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our electric operations, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate and could impair our ability to make distributions to shareholders or scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements. Four of our operating companies have single customers that provide a significant portion of the individual operating company’s and the business segment’s revenue. The loss of, or significant reduction in revenue from, any one of these customers would have a significant negative financial impact on the operating company and its business segment and could have a significant negative financial impact on the Company.

Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window and door lock functions. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing, and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees, or suppliers are subject to increasingly complex, restrictive, and punitive regulations in all key market regions.  Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Because many of these laws are new, there is little clarity as to their interpretation, as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future.

The amendments in this update will change the accounting guidance we follow for long-duration insurance contracts. The most notable amendment included in ASU 2018-12 will require us to update assumptions used in measuring future policy benefits, including mortality and persistency, at least annually instead of locking those assumptions at contract inception and reflecting differences in assumptions and actual performance as the experience occurs. ASU 2018-12 also includes changes to how we amortize DAC and determine and update the discount rate assumptions used in measuring future policy benefits reserves while increasing the level of financial statement disclosures required. The amendments in ASU 2018-12 are scheduled to be effective for the Company beginning in 2021 as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements.

Significant additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income. Non-performing loans may increase and non-performing or delinquent loans may adversely affect future performance.

Also, any negative publicity associated with one of the two companies in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other.

Our billboard businesses are regulated by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations could limit our growth by putting constraints on the number, location and timing of billboards we wish to erect. New regulations and changes to existing regulations may also curtail our ability to expand our billboard business and adversely affect us by reducing our revenues or increasing our operating expenses. For example, settlements between major tobacco companies and all U.S. states and certain U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Alcohol products and other products may be future targets of advertising bans, and legislation, litigation or out-of-court settlements may result in the implementation of additional advertising restrictions that impact our business. Any significant reduction in alcohol-related advertising or the advertising of other products due to content-related restrictions could negatively impact our revenues generated from such businesses and cause an increase in the existing inventory of available outdoor billboard space throughout the industry.

Regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge, and have challenged, the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations.  Some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates.  Further, the FERC may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have over-collected on rates charged to shippers.  We may face challenges, similar to those described in Note 18 ""Litigation, Environmental and Other Contingencies"" to our consolidated financial statements, to the rates we charge on our pipelines.  In addition, following the 2017 Tax Reform, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the FERC initiated the Form 501-G process to review the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform on interstate pipelines with respect to tax recovery in existing jurisdictional rates.

Any of our properties that become vacant could be difficult to sell or re-lease at similar or favorable rental rates or at all. We have and may continue to experience vacancies either by the default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases. We typically must incur all of the costs of ownership for a property that is vacant. Upon or pending the expiration of leases at our properties, we may be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants, or accommodate requests for lower rents, remodeling and other improvements, in order to retain and attract tenants. Certain of our properties may be specifically suited to the particular needs of a tenant (e.g., a retail bank branch or distribution warehouse) and major renovations and expenditures may be required in order for us to re-lease the space for other uses. If the vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues, resulting in less cash available for distribution to our stockholders and unitholders. If we are unable to renew leases, lease vacant space, including vacant space resulting from tenant defaults, or re-lease space as leases expire, on favorable terms or at all, our financial condition could be adversely affected.

If a subsequent development, such as a delay in the closing of the acquisition or a delay in the construction of a property, causes any such investment, in the opinion of the allocation committee, to be more appropriate for an entity other than the entity that committed to make the investment, the allocation committee may determine that the Company or a program sponsored by CCA will make the investment.",0.4462713,22.7862572222222,53,-6.64016837333333

U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about certain issues, including when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent certain deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless equity securities, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and interest income, as well as whether exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. These matters could cause us to recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even in the absence of cash or economic gain, and require us to make taxable distributions to our stockholders to maintain our RIC status or preclude the imposition of either U.S. federal corporate income or excise taxation. Additionally, because such taxable income may not be matched by corresponding cash received by us, we may be required to borrow money or dispose of other investments to be able to make distributions to our stockholders. These and other issues will be considered by us, to the extent determined necessary, so that we aim to minimize the level of any U.S. federal income or excise tax that we would otherwise incur.

Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.

If we cease to be eligible for an exemption from regulation as a commodity pool operator, our compliance expenses could increase substantially. Second-Lien and Mezzanine Debt. Our investments in second-lien and mezzanine debt generally are subordinated to senior loans and will either have junior security interests or be unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. This may result in greater risk and loss of principal. As part of our business strategy, we borrow from and may in the future issue additional senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders. Holders of these loans or senior securities would have fixed-dollar claims on our assets that have priority over the claims of our stockholders. If the value of our assets decreases, leverage will cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have without leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause our net income to decline more sharply than it would have if we had not borrowed. This decline could negatively affect our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock. Our ability to service our borrowings depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures.

To securitize our investments, we likely would create a wholly owned subsidiary, contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary and have the subsidiary issue primarily investment grade debt securities to purchasers who we would expect would be willing to accept a substantially lower interest rate than the loans earn. We would retain all or a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. Our retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio of investments before any of the debt securities would be exposed to the losses. An inability to successfully securitize our investment portfolio could limit our ability to grow or fully execute our business and could adversely affect our earnings, if any. The successful securitization of our investment could expose us to losses because the portions of the securitized investments that we would typically retain tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses. The 1940 Act also may impose restrictions on the structure of any securitization. In connection with any future securitization of investments, we may incur greater set-up and administration fees relating to such vehicles than we have in connection with financing of our investments in the past.

After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention.

Our business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of computer system failures or security breaches. As is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing such patents is costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that a ""naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,"" invalidating Myriad Genetics' patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Certain claims of our licensed U.S. patents covering DTX301 and DTX401 relate to isolated AAV8 vectors, capsid proteins, or nucleic acids. To the extent that such claims are deemed to be directed to natural products, or to lack an inventive concept above and beyond an isolated natural product, a court may decide the claims are invalid under Myriad. Additionally, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Patent policy and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.",0.032577835,21.7226698888889,32,2.31822492444444

These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) which changes, among other things, the way companies must record expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, available for sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis.

Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom previously expressed serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that negatively impacted our operations and results, and future changes to our operations as a result of regulator concerns could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. business. In 2014, the FCA issued the CONC contained in the FCA Handbook. The CONC incorporates prescriptive regulations for consumer loans such as those that we offer, including mandatory affordability checks on borrowers, limiting the number of rollovers on short-term loans to two, restricting how lenders can advertise, banning advertisements that the FCA deems misleading, and introducing a limit of two unsuccessful attempts on the use of continuous payment authority (which provides a creditor the ability to directly debit a customer's account for payment when authorized by the customer to do so) to pay off a loan. The provisions of the CONC took effect in 2014. As a result of the FCA's requirements, we made significant adjustments to many of our business practices in the United Kingdom, as discussed below under "" -  Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom previously expressed serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that negatively impacted our operations and results, and future changes to our operations as a result of regulator concerns could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. business.""

Although there continue to be judicial challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court has thus far upheld the Affordable Care Act, including, most recently, in their June 25, 2015 ruling on King v. Burwell. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order aimed at seeking the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. In addition, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA. The TCJA repealed the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act starting in 2019. Also, on December 14, 2018, in Texas v. Azar, the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas invalidated the Affordable Care Act based on the removal of the individual mandate provision by the TCJA, although the decision has been stayed pending appeal. We cannot predict whether any future attempts to amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act will be successful or that the decision in Texas v. Azar will be overturned or confirmed on appeal.

1535929,"Although we believe the Transaction to have been successful to date, it is possible that we may not achieve certain of the benefits that we expect to obtain in connection with the Transaction. For example, it is possible that expected revenues from the appointment of Voya IM or its affiliated advisors as the preferred asset management partner for Venerable may not fully materialize, that our equity investment in Venerable may lose value, or that the ultimate Transaction value to us is less than we anticipated. The Transaction also requires us to provide certain transition services to Venerable, and has created the need to eliminate certain stranded costs, each of which creates additional operational complexity for our business. In addition, as provided for in the MTA governing the Transaction, we and VA Capital are currently involved in discussions concerning the final true-up payment for the businesses we sold, and have not yet reached agreement on the amount. See Overview in the Management's  Discussion and Analysis section in Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Should the Transaction ultimately prove to be less beneficial that we anticipated, or should the transition services, stranded cost elimination, or other Transaction effects create difficulties for our business, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, possibly in a material way. Item 1A.     Risk Factors Our financial results are subject to risks around actuarial assumptions, including those related to mortality and the future behavior of policyholders, such as lapse rates and future claims payment patterns. These assumptions, which we use to determine our liabilities for future policy benefits, may not reflect future experience. Changes to these actuarial assumptions in the future could require increases to our reserves or result in decreases in the carrying value of DAC/VOBA and other intangibles, in each case in amounts that could be material. Any adverse changes to reserves or DAC/VOBA and other intangibles balances could require us to make material additional capital contributions to one or more of our insurance company subsidiaries or could otherwise be material and adverse to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. We generally update these actuarial assumptions in the third quarter of each year. For further information, see Results of Operations and  Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates of Part II.

1538263,"in Item I of this Form 10-K. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter the regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and the manner in which firms within the industry conduct business. In this regard, in May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act""), was enacted to reduce the application of certain financial reform regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act, on community banks such as us. The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single ""Community Bank Leverage Ratio"" of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that they may impact the profitability of our business activities and enhance our ability to originate residential loans while reducing our operating and compliance costs. In addition to this new legislation, federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Future changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies are expected to occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. These changes may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent registered public accounting firm. These accounting changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes.",0.19615796,19.6941113333333,52,-3.75761748333333

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. As a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts.

We could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain a strong management team. Our General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price. We are relying on DMI to indemnify us for any costs or expenses that we incur for environmental liabilities and third-party claims, regardless of when a claim is made, that are based on environmental conditions in existence prior to the closing of the IPO at our Predecessor Entity's sites. To the extent escrow accounts, insurance and/or payments from DMI are not sufficient to cover any such costs or expenses, our business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to make distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected. Any acquisitions are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders. We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, and the cost of complying with such laws may be material. Management fees and cost reimbursements due to our General Partner and Couche-Tard for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner. The liability of DMI and Couche-Tard is limited under our Amended Omnibus Agreement and we have agreed to indemnify DMI and Couche-Tard against certain liabilities, which may expose us to significant expenses. Changes in consumer behavior and travel as a result of changing economic conditions, labor strikes or otherwise could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders.

The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. A significant amount of our income is attributable to our leasing of real property to DMS. If DMS were to become related to us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the real property rents that we receive from DMS would no longer constitute qualifying income and we would likely be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd - Frank Act, and the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies.  In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd - Frank Act are expected to require additional changes.  We expect that compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, will substantially increase our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time - consuming and costly.  We also expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as officers. A substantial portion of our total outstanding common stock may be sold into the market at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well, and make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.

1538990,"In the recent past, the credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, displacement and liquidity disruptions, including the bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring of certain financial institutions. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making financing terms for customers less attractive, and in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of various types of debt financing. As a result, we may be unable to obtain debt financing on favorable terms or at all or fully refinance maturing indebtedness with new indebtedness (including indebtedness that requires us to make a lump-sum or ""balloon"" payment at maturity). Reductions in our available borrowing capacity or inability to obtain credit when required or when business conditions warrant could materially and adversely affect us.  Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well. If interest rates increase, our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase, which could materially and adversely affect us. Construction and renovation risks could adversely affect our profitability. Failure of our subsidiaries to make required payments on borrowings secured by a significant portion of our assets could materially and adversely affect us. Limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of us restrict the transferability of our stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status. Even if we qualify as a REIT for purposes of the Code, we may be subject to other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Reduced discretionary spending by consumers could reduce the demand for our net - lease solutions. Some of our customers operate under franchise or license agreements, which, if terminated or not renewed prior to the expiration of their leases with us, would likely impair their ability to pay us rent.

1538990,"If a customer defaults under either the ground lease or mortgage loan of a hybrid lease, we may be required to undertake foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage before we can re - lease or sell the property. We have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which may expose us to inflation risk and can hinder our growth and profitability. As leases expire, we may be unable to renew those leases or re - lease the space on favorable terms or at all. Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS The loss of a customer, either through lease expiration or customer bankruptcy or insolvency, may require us to spend significant amounts of capital to renovate the property before it is suitable for a new customer and cause us to incur significant costs in the form of ongoing expenses for property maintenance, taxes, insurance and other expenses. Uninsured losses relating to real property may adversely affect our returns. Certain provisions of our leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable, which could adversely impact us. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, which could materially and adversely affect us. In certain circumstances, we may enter into hybrid leases with customers.  A hybrid lease is a modified sale - leaseback transaction, where the customer sells us land and then we lease the land back to the customer under a ground lease and simultaneously make a mortgage loan to the customer secured by the improvements the customer continues to own.  If a customer defaults under a hybrid lease, we may: (i) evict the customer under the ground lease and assume ownership of the improvements; or (ii) if required by a court, foreclose on the mortgage loan that is secured by the improvements.  Under a ground lease, we as ground lessor generally become the owner of the improvements on the land at lease maturity or if the customer defaults.  If, upon default, a court requires us to foreclose on the mortgage rather than evicting the customer, we might encounter delays and expenses in obtaining possession of the improvements, which in turn could delay our ability to sell or re - lease the property in a prompt manner, which could materially and adversely affect us. We face significant competition for customers and the acquisition of STORE Properties, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties, and may reduce the number of acquisitions we are able to complete or may increase the cost of these acquisitions.",0.43637407,22.6182904444444,53,-9.57080974555556

Our target market is middle - market companies that operate their businesses out of one or more locations that generate unit - level profitability for the business.  Historically, many companies prefer to own, rather than lease, the real estate they use in their businesses.  A failure to increase demand for our products by, among other ways, failing to convince middle - market companies to sell and lease back their STORE Properties, a decrease in the demand of middle - market companies to rent STORE Properties, or an increase in the availability of STORE Properties for rent could materially and adversely affect us. We could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. We depend on key personnel; the loss of their full service could materially impair our ability to operate successfully. Some of our customers rely on government funding, and their failure to continue to qualify for such funding could adversely impact their ability to make timely lease payments to us. We will continue to incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which will negatively impact our financial performance. Current market conditions, including increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing for growth on acceptable terms or at all. In certain instances, we provide financing to our customers for the construction and/or renovation of their properties. We are therefore subject to the risks that this construction or renovation may not be completed.  Construction and renovation costs for a property may exceed a customer's original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that are unexpected.  A customer may also be unable to complete construction or renovation of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs.  These additional expenses may affect the ability of the customer to make payments to us. Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates and could reduce the overall returns on an investment in our company. We depend on the asset - backed securities, or ABS, and the commercial mortgage - backed securities, or CMBS, markets for a substantial portion of our long - term debt financing.",0.43637407,22.6182904444444,53,-9.57080974555556

For example, we and other approved insurers are currently drafting new master policies to, among other things, include terms that will conform to the new RRPs.

As a result, they may be better positioned to compete in and outside of the traditional MI market, including when the GSEs pursue alternative forms of credit enhancement other than private MI. In particular, in 2018, each GSE piloted a new credit risk transfer program under which the GSE purchases high-LTV loans (i.e., LTVs above 80%) without MI and subsequently places mortgage insurance with a captive insurer controlled by one of our competitors, which captive in turn cedes 100% of the risk to a panel of offshore reinsurers. Freddie Mac's program is known as IMAGIN and Fannie Mae's program is known as Enterprise-Paid Mortgage Insurance or EPMI. We believe these programs compete with traditional LPMI products offered by private MI companies, including ours, and they may gain traction in the market if, and to the extent, the pricing for these products is lower than prevailing LPMI rates and features of the GSEs' offerings cause originators and the GSEs to materially modify their historical preference for private MI as credit enhancement on high-LTV loans.

1547903,"Our practice, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) for the MI industry, is to establish loss reserves only for loans that servicers have reported to us as being at least 60 days in default. We also establish IBNR reserves for estimated losses incurred on loans that have been in default for at least 60 days that have not yet been reported to us by the servicers. The establishment of loss and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. We establish loss reserves using our best estimates of claim rates, i.e., the percent of loan defaults that ultimately result in claim payments, and claim amounts, i.e., the dollar amounts required to settle claims, to estimate the ultimate losses on loans reported to us as being at least 60 days in default as of the end of each reporting period. We estimate IBNR reserves by analyzing historical lags in default reporting to determine a specific number of IBNR claims in each reporting period. Our estimates of claim rates and claim sizes are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including current rates or trends in unemployment, housing price appreciation and/or interest rates, and our best judgments as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors. These factors are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Further, our expectations regarding future claims may change significantly over time. If prevailing economic conditions deteriorate suddenly and/or unexpectedly, our estimates of loss reserves could be materially understated. Due to the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in the numerous assumptions required to estimate our losses, our loss estimates may vary widely.  Because loss and IBNR reserves are based on such estimates and judgments, there can be no assurance that even in a stable economic environment, actual claims paid by us will not be substantially different than our loss and IBNR reserves for such claims.

1547903,"The PMIERs provide that the table of factors that determine minimum required assets will be updated every two years or more frequently to reflect macroeconomic conditions, loan performance or to address other issues the GSEs deem important. In addition, the GSEs may amend or clarify other aspects of the PMIERs at any time. On September 27, 2018, the GSEs published revised PMIERs, including updated financial requirements, which will take effect and become applicable to NMIC on March 31, 2019. We expect that NMIC will remain in full compliance with the revised PMIERs, as applicable, prior to and after March 31, 2019; however, there is no assurance NMIC will remain in compliance or that the GSEs will not make the PMIERs financial requirements more onerous in the future. If any future updates to the PMIERs would require NMIC to materially increase the amount of available assets to support its business writings, the amount of capital NMIC is required to hold will increase, which may have a negative effect on our returns. Any such effect could have a negative impact on our flexibility to meet our business plans and our future operating results. We provide loan review services for certain of our customers, including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance. Under the terms of our loan review agreements with customers and subject to contractual limitations on liability, we provide these customers with limited indemnity rights if we make a material error in providing such services and the error materially restricts or impairs the saleability of a loan, results in a material reduction in the value of a loan or results in the customer being required to repurchase a loan. The indemnification may be in the form of monetary or other remedies, subject to per loan and annual limitations. Accordingly, we have assumed some credit risk in connection with providing these services. We also face regulatory and litigation risk in providing these services.  See ""The private MI industry is, and as a participant we are, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally,"" below.",0.11222449,21.0742358888889,52,-1.34752690666667
1547903,"remedial and financial requirements applicable to approved insurers. By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements, some of which do not have materiality thresholds. We certified to the GSEs by April 15, 2018 that NMIC was in full compliance with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2017. We have established underwriting and credit risk management policies and practices that seek to mitigate our exposure to borrower default risk in our insured loan portfolio by anticipating future risks and the magnitude of those risks. Our underwriting and credit risk management guidelines are based on what we believe to be the major factors that influence the performance of mortgage credit, including borrower and loan-level risk characteristics, lender origination practices and macroeconomic variables that influence the housing market. The presence of multiple higher-risk characteristics (i.e., layered risk) in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a default on such a loan unless, and to the extent, there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk. There can be no assurance, however, that NMIC will continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements. If NMIC were to experience a material reduction to revenues or an unexpected, significant increase in losses, NMIC's available assets could fall below the minimum required assets mandated by the PMIERs financial requirements. In addition, as NMIC continues to grow its business and increase its net RIF, NMIC may need to raise additional capital or reduce its net RIF, including through the use of additional reinsurance, to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and to continue to support new business writings.  Any future growth capital may be in the form of debt, equity, or a combination of both.  We can give no assurance that our efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful.",0.11222449,21.0742358888889,52,-1.34752690666667
1547903,"Further, at the direction of the FHFA, the GSEs have expanded their credit and mortgage risk transfer programs.  These programs have included the use of structured finance vehicles, obtaining insurance from non-mortgage insurers (e.g., IMAGIN and EPMI), including off-shore reinsurance, engaging in credit-linked note transactions in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors. The growing success of these programs and the perception that some of these risk-sharing structures have beneficial features in comparison to private MI (e.g., lower costs, reduced counter-party risk due to collateral requirements or more diversified insurance exposures) may create increased competition for private MI on loans traditionally sold to the GSEs with private MI. The requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of approved insurers, including NMIC. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could materially reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs. NMIC is a GSE approved insurer, and the significant majority of insurance we write is on loans sold to the GSEs.  (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, the GSE's eligibility requirements.) As a result, our compliance with the PMIERs is necessary to maintain NMIC's status as an approved insurer.

1547903,"Our financial strength ratings are important for our customers to maintain confidence in our products and our competitive position. PMIERs require all approved insurers, except newly-approved insurers, to maintain at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the GSEs. A downgrade in NMIC's ratings or ratings outlook, or our failure to maintain a rating acceptable to one or both of the GSEs, could have an adverse effect on our business, including (i) potentially impacting our eligibility as an approved insurer, (ii) increased scrutiny of our financial condition by our customers, resulting in potential reduction in our NIW or (iii) negative impacts to our ability to conduct business in the non-GSE mortgage market, where financial strength ratings may be a more important counter-party consideration for lenders. Our dividend income is limited to upstream dividend payments from our subsidiaries. With respect to our insurance subsidiaries, under Wisconsin law, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed ""extraordinary"" and require approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed also limit or restrict their ability to pay dividends. It is possible that Wisconsin and other states that have dividend restrictions will adopt revised statutory provisions or interpretations of existing statutory provisions that could be more restrictive than those currently in effect or will otherwise take actions that may further restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or returns of capital.  In addition, under the PMIERs, if an approved insurer fails to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, such approved insurer may not pay dividends without the prior approval of the GSEs. While Re One currently has the capacity to pay ordinary dividends, NMIC reported a statutory net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and cannot pay any ordinary dividends to NMIH through December 31, 2019 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. As a result of the state dividend limitations, we do not expect to receive material dividend income from our subsidiaries for several years, if at all.",0.11222449,21.0742358888889,52,-1.34752690666667
1547903,"NMIC's principal regulator is the Wisconsin OCI.  Under applicable Wisconsin law, as well as that of 15 other states, a mortgage insurer must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction that has such a requirement, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. Wisconsin and certain other states, including California and Illinois, apply a substantially similar requirement referred to as minimum policyholders' position. If our business grows faster (i.e., our RIF grows faster than expected) or is less profitable than expected (i.e., our revenues do not generate the return we expect), our actual RTC ratios over the short to mid-term could exceed our expected RTC ratios and could begin to approach the limits to which we are subject, which could require us to enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance, or raise additional capital.  We can give no assurance that our efforts to obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF, or to raise capital would be successful.  If we are unable to obtain additional reinsurance or enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF or raise additional capital, we may exceed these state-imposed capital requirements.  Accordingly, if we fail to meet the capital adequacy requirements in one or more states, we could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which we do business. If, in the future, NMIC fails to comply with the PMIERs, including the financial requirements, it may lose its approved insurer status from one or both GSEs, or may have to enter into a remediation plan (with the approval of the GSEs), curtail its business writings or cease transacting new business altogether.  Any of these events would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future business prospects.",0.11222449,21.0742358888889,52,-1.34752690666667

To the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary MI coverage, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced.

1556263,"Further, the America Invents Act created new procedures to challenge the validity of issued patents in the United States, including post-grant review and inter partes review proceedings, which some third parties have been using to cause the cancellation of selected or all claims of issued patents of competitors. For a patent with an effective filing date of March 16, 2013 or later, a petition for post-grant review can be filed by a third party in a nine-month window from issuance of the patent. A petition for inter partes review can be filed immediately following the issuance of a patent if the patent has an effective filing date prior to March 16, 2013. A petition for inter partes review can be filed after the nine-month period for filing a post-grant review petition has expired for a patent with an effective filing date of March 16, 2013 or later.

HPIH is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its net taxable income is generally allocated to its members, including us, pro rata according to the number of Membership Interests each member owns. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of HPIH and also incur expenses related to our operations. We intend to cause HPIH to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount at least equal to the amount necessary to cover their respective tax liabilities, if any, with respect to their allocable share of the net income of HPIH and to cover dividends, if any, declared by us, as well as any payments due under the tax receivable agreement, as described below. To the extent that we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, and HPIH is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements, laws or regulations or does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the income tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.",0.27474084,19.5596492222222,52,3.98474698888889

1568162,"Under authoritative accounting guidance for leases through December 31, 2018, a lease was classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet. If the lease did not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease was considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation did not appear on the tenant's balance sheet, rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease could have appeared to enhance a tenant's balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. The new standards, which were effective as of January 1, 2019 for public business entities, affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants. These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted. For example, as a result of the revised accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases, companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated. For additional information on the new standard issued in the U.S., which we adopted on January 1, 2019, see Note 3  -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  -  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",0.47659555,20.6761325555556,53,-4.68763602777778

Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us. A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated. We own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business. These ""co-tenancy"" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants lease space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us. If these tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases or seek a rent reduction.  Even if co-tenancy rights do not exist, other tenants may experience downturns in their businesses that could threaten their ongoing ability to continue paying rent and remain solvent.  In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.  Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.  The transfer to a new anchor tenant, or the bankruptcy, insolvency or downturn in business of any of our anchor tenants, could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center. Many expenses associated with properties (such as operating expenses and capital expenses) cannot be reduced when there is a reduction in income from the properties.  A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center. If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to remodel the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.",0.47659555,20.6761325555556,53,-4.68763602777778

The ITC matter is entitled In the Matter of Certain Botulinum Toxin Products, or the ITC Complaint.  The ITC instituted an investigation as ITC Inv. No. 337-TA-1145.  The ITC complaint calls for an investigation by the ITC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.  The ITC complaint seeks (i) an investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, (ii) a hearing with the ITC on permanent relief, (iii) issuance of a limited exclusion order forbidding entry of Jeuveau™ into the United States, (iv) a cease and desist order prohibiting Daewoong and us from engaging in the importations, sale for importation, marketing, distribution, offering for sale, the sale after the importation of, or otherwise transferring Jeuveau™ within the United States, (v) a bond issued during the presidential review period, (vi) the return of Medytox's trade secrets and other confidential information including the alleged stolen BTX Strain, and (vii) exclusion and cease and desist orders. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in the proceedings. An adverse ruling by the ITC against either us or Daewoong could result in the imposition of an exclusion order which would bar imports of Jeuveau™ into the United States and a cease and desist order which would bar sales and marketing of our sole product Jeuveau™ within the United Sates either of which would adversely affect our ability to carry our out our business and which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and could also result in reputational harm. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Additionally, in certain cases if there is preliminary or permanent relief granted under the Medytox Litigation or the ITC matter, it may constitute an event of default under our credit facility.

These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that such arrangements would not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes or that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. In addition, interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. Hedging could reduce the overall returns on our investments. In addition, while such agreements would be intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they could also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements would not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements or that the underlying transactions could fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank"") went into effect in 2010. Dodd-Frank created a new regulatory framework for oversight of derivatives transactions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC"") and the SEC.

In addition, Dodd-Frank contemplates that where appropriate in light of outstanding exposures, trading liquidity and other factors, swaps (broadly defined to include most hedging instruments other than futures) will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. There are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. While we believe we qualify for one or more of such exceptions (including with respect to our existing interest rate swaps), the scope of these exceptions is still considered uncertain and will be further defined over time. Further, although we may qualify for exceptions, our derivatives counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the legislation, which may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into additional hedging transactions on favorable terms.

Certain of our assets such as gasoline terminals and certain retail fueling stores lie near the U.S. coastline and are vulnerable to hurricane and tropical storm damages, which may result in shutdowns. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November, but the most severe storm activities usually occur in late summer, such as with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017. Although we maintain insurance for certain of these risks as described below, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured. Changes in credit card expenses could reduce our gross margin, especially on gasoline. Our leverage may increase the overall cost of debt funding and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us.  Our leverage could increase with additional borrowings on our shelf registration statement.  We have below investment-grade ratings from Moody's and S&P based on our current capital structure. Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a ratings agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If our existing ratings are lowered, or otherwise we do not obtain an investment grade rating in the future, or if we do and a rating agency were to downgrade us again to below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.",0.43294138,21.8105206666667,44,-1.40684624666667
1573516,"From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have entered into a credit facility to provide us with available financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes. This credit facility is intended to meet any ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our credit facility. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our credit facility to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.  Further, since the credit facility is secured by receivables and inventories, low commodity prices can limit the borrowing base to an Except in limited cases, we typically do not seek to hedge any significant portion of our exposure to the effects of changing prices of commodities. Dramatic increases in oil prices reduce retail gasoline gross margins, because wholesale gasoline costs typically increase faster than retailers are able to pass them along to customers. We purchase refined products, particularly gasoline, needed to supply our retail stores. Therefore, our most significant costs are subject to volatility of prices for these commodities. Our ability to successfully manage operating costs is important because we have little or no influence on the sales prices or regional and worldwide consumer demand for oil and gasoline. Furthermore, oil prices, wholesale motor fuel costs, motor fuel sales volumes, motor fuel gross margins and merchandise sales can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, consumer demand for motor fuel typically increases during the summer driving season, and typically falls during the winter months. Travel, recreation and construction are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel and merchandise that we sell. Therefore, our revenues and/or sales volumes are typically higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. A significant change in any of these factors, including a significant decrease in consumer demand (other than typical seasonal variations), could materially affect our motor fuel and merchandise volumes, motor fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",0.43294138,21.8105206666667,44,-1.40684624666667

Our master lease agreement states that if Murphy Oil USA, Inc. is acquired or becomes party to any merger or consolidation that results in a material change in the management of the stores, Walmart will have the option to purchase the stores at fair market value. The master lease also prohibits us from selling all or any portion of a station without first offering to sell all or such portion to Walmart on the same terms and conditions. These provisions may restrict our ability to conduct our business on the terms and in the manner we consider most favorable and may adversely affect our future growth. We operate in the oil and gas industry and experience intense competition from other independent retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies. The U.S. marketing petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing and marketing petroleum and other refined products. We compete with other chains of retail fuel stores for fuel supply and in the retail sale of refined products to end consumers, primarily on the basis of price, but also on the basis of convenience and consumer appeal. In addition, we may also face competition from other retail fueling stores that adopt marketing strategies similar to ours by associating with non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, discount club stores and hypermarkets, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate. We expect that our industry will continue to trend toward this model, resulting in increased competition to us over time. Moreover, because we do not produce or refine any of the petroleum or other refined products that we market, we compete with retail gasoline companies that have ongoing supply relationships with affiliates or former affiliates that manufacture refined products. We also compete with integrated companies that have their own production and/or refining operations that are at times able to offset losses from marketing operations with profits from producing or refining operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed retail margins or supply shortages. In addition, we compete with other retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies that have more extensive retail outlets and greater brand name recognition. Some of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business and may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry. Such competition could adversely affect us, including our profitability, our ability to grow and our ability to manage our business.",0.43294138,21.8105206666667,44,-1.40684624666667

Significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products, as well as future legislation and national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the United States, may have an adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products, and therefore reduce our revenues and profits. Also, increasing regulations, including those for e-cigarettes and vapor products could offset some of the recent gains we have experienced from selling these products.  Competitive pressures in our markets can make it difficult to pass price increases on to our customers. We also operate in some jurisdictions that have recently raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21. These factors could materially and adversely affect our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and sales, merchandise gross margin and overall customer traffic. Reduced sales of tobacco products or smaller gross margins on the sales we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our owned properties that were purchased from Walmart are subject to Easements with Covenants and Restrictions Affecting Land (the ""ECRs"") between us and Walmart. The ECRs impose customary restrictions on the use of our properties, which Walmart has the right to enforce.

These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action.

1577916,"On June 28, 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which imposes significant changes in data privacy regulation in response to consumer demand for better protection of personal data and privacy.   CCPA imposes consumer protections that are comparable to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") and is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.  In the wake of the CCPA's passage, approximately 15 other states have introduced similar privacy legislation.  Similar proposals are also being considered at the federal level.  The CCPA will apply to a wide range of businesses that handle Californians' personal information and is not limited in scope to entities that have physical operations in California.  It applies to for-profit entities ""doing business"" in the state that either: (i) have a gross annual revenue in excess of $25 million; or (ii) annually buy, receive for commercial purposes, sell or share for commercial purposes personal information of 50,000 or more California consumers, households or devices; or, (iii) derive 50% or more of their annual revenues from selling California consumers' personal information.  CCPA broadens the definition of personal information to include data elements not previously considered under any U.S. law, and we anticipate that we will have to comply with new requirements governing the collection, use and sharing of personal information, including updating the disclosures in our privacy notices, establishing processes for responding to consumer rights requests, observing restrictions on data monetization practices and potentially revisiting relationships with vendors that handle personal information on our behalf.  Violations of the CCPA are subject to enforcement by the California Attorney General's office, which can seek civil penalties of $2,500 for each violation or $7,500 for each intentional violation after notice and a 30-day opportunity to cure have been provided. Enforcement activities under the CCPA will be delayed until six months after publication of the Attorney General's implementation guidelines, or July 1, 2020, whichever is sooner.  Between now and January 1, 2020 there are likely to be amendments to the CCPA and it is therefore too early to assess the impact that compliance will have on our business.",0.013080414,21.5005087777778,42,1.01061919088889

Our facilities used to finance vehicle lease originations also have a residual loss ratio limit calculated with respect to our serviced lease portfolio as a whole based on maturing leases returned to SC. We regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer be aligned with our strategic objectives. For example, in 2015, we disclosed a decision to exit our personal lending business and to explore strategic alternatives for our existing personal lending assets. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.

Additionally, we may ultimately dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than those we had originally anticipated. After reaching a definitive agreement with a buyer, we typically must satisfy pre-closing conditions and the completion of the transaction may be subject to regulatory and governmental approvals.

This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an ""expected credit loss"" approach rather than the ""incurred loss"" approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability.

Risks Related to Third Parties In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA) and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of such product candidates. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be significantly more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere. It is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere, or how long it will take to commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, approvals by one regulatory authority may not be indicative of what other regulatory authorities may require for approval, and approvals of ex vivo gene therapy products may not be indicative of what may be required for approval of in vivo gene therapy products. The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue. Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates Our business depends substantially on the success of our lead product candidates. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our lead product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. Even if we receive regulatory approval, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize our lead product candidates or any future product candidate, and the revenue that we generate from any approved product's sales, if any, could be limited. We may find it difficult to enroll patients in clinical trials, and this could delay or prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials of our product candidates. If we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.",0.022684913,21.0016276666667,32,2.72350727622222

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders. We and third parties on which we rely may be harmed by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. We may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our licensing activities, product development efforts or other operations. Further, the regulatory authorities may require concurrent approval or the CE mark (a mandatory conformity assessment marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area (the EEA)) of a companion diagnostic device, since it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or FDA-approved, or CE-marked, diagnostic tests or diagnostic tests approved by other comparable foreign regulatory authorities to diagnose patients or to assure the safe and effective use of our product candidates in trial subjects. FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion diagnostic devices. The FDA has articulated a policy position that, when safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic device, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA's guidance allows for two exceptions to the general rule of concurrent drug/device approval, namely, when the therapeutic product is intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions for which no alternative exists, and when a serious safety issue arises for an approved therapeutic agent, and no FDA-cleared or FDA-approved companion diagnostic test is yet available. It is unclear how the FDA will apply this policy to our current or future gene therapy product candidates. Should the FDA deem genetic tests used for diagnosing patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring FDA clearance or approval, we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval of a BLA for our product candidates.

1591670,"In addition, the Code imposes restrictions on a REIT's ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. In particular, the tax laws applicable to REITs effectively require that we hold our properties for investment, rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interests. Moreover, if we acquire properties from C corporations (i.e., corporations generally subject to full corporate-level tax) in certain non-taxable transactions, as was the case with our acquisition of the Hudye Farm in 2014, built-in gain recognized on the non-taxable disposition of such properties within 5 years of our acquisition will be subject to tax at the highest applicable U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.

The final rules will also impose new requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including gathering lines. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.

These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.",0.18349712,21.0591305555556,32,-0.135158911

Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidate is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory agencies denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all targeted indications. including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented. This reform adds uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to our patents in the future. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to TRC101 and our technology. Since patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidate. Once granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because even granted intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business.

Viewability of digital advertising inventory is relevant to marketers because it represents a way of assessing the value of particular inventory as a means to reach a target audience. However, there is no consensus definition of viewability. Some approaches focus on whether an advertisement can be seen at all, and others focus on whether an advertisement that can be seen is actually seen, in whole or part, or for how long. Low viewability can be caused by various factors, including technical issues (e.g. device screen size, browser functionality and settings, web site load times), media design (e.g. below-the-fold or sub-page placements), and user behavior (e.g. the decision whether to scroll down a website or click on an advertisement or how long to watch a video). Non-viewability is a separate issue and may result, for example, from stacking ads so the one in the back is obscured, or serving ads into a single pixel space too small to be seen.",0.056977626,19.9305894444444,51,-0.468807398888889

1597553,"In addition, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. The full impact of these decisions is not yet known. For example, on March 20, 2012 in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. The decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and it has created uncertainty around the ability to obtain patent protection for certain inventions. Additionally, on June 13, 2013 in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA molecules are patent eligible because they are not a natural product. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain. On June 19, 2014 in Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, et al., a case involving patent claims directed to a method for mitigating settlement risk, the Court held that the patent eligibility of claims directed to abstract ideas, products of nature, and laws of nature should be determined using the same framework set forth in Prometheus. The U.S. PTO recently issued a set of guidelines setting forth procedures for determining subject matter eligibility of claims directed to abstract ideas, products of nature, and laws of nature in line with the Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice decisions. The guidance does not limit the application of Myriad to DNA but, rather, applies the decision to other natural products.

1597553,"If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent, if and when issued, covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, ex parte reexamination, or inter partes review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g., opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or competitive products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. Unfavorable U.S. or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.

Our business would be adversely affected while such review is ongoing and if we are ultimately unable to obtain premarket clearance, approval or de novo authorization. For example, the regulatory premarket clearance, approval or de novo authorization process may involve, among other things, successfully completing analytical, pre-clinical and/or clinical studies beyond the studies we have already performed or plan to perform for each of our products and would involve submitting a premarket notification, or 510(k), a de novo application, or filing a PMA application with the FDA.

Under this model, clinical laboratories around the world, including the U.S., license our technology to develop and run their own NIPT or other molecular testing assays in their own facilities, and then access our proprietary algorithms through our cloud-based Constellation software to analyze the assay results. In the diagnostics industry, the market for cloud-based solutions and services is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it remains uncertain whether and to what extent our cloud-based distribution model will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance.

In particular, we are subject to the risk that the biological characteristics of the genetic mutations we seek to target, and upon which our technologies rely, are uncertain and difficult to predict. For example, in our efforts to detect and analyze circulating tumor DNA in plasma for cancer screening, our success depends on tumors shedding mutant DNA into the bloodstream in sufficient quantities such that our technology can detect such mutations.

1604950,"Further, the America Invents Act created new procedures to challenge the validity of issued patents in the United States, including post-grant review and inter partes review proceedings, which some third parties have been using to cause the cancellation of selected or all claims of issued patents. For a patent with an effective filing date of March 16, 2013 or later, a petition for post-grant review can be filed by a third party in a nine month window from issuance of the patent. A petition for inter partes review can be filed immediately following the issuance of a patent if the patent has an effective filing date prior to March 16, 2013. A petition for inter partes review can be filed after the nine month period for filing a post-grant review petition has expired for a patent with an effective filing date of March 16, 2013 or later. Post-grant review proceedings can be brought on any ground of invalidity, whereas inter partes review proceedings can only raise an invalidity challenge based on published prior art and patents. In these adversarial actions, the USPTO reviews patent claims without the presumption of validity afforded to U.S. patents in lawsuits in U.S. federal courts and uses a lower burden of proof than used in litigation in U.S. federal courts. Therefore, it is generally considered easier for a competitor or third party to have a U.S. patent invalidated in a USPTO post-grant review or inter partes review proceeding than invalidated in a litigation in a U.S. federal court. If any of our or our licensors' patents are challenged by a third party in such a USPTO proceeding, there is no guarantee that we or our licensors or collaborators will be successful in defending the patent, which would result in a loss of the challenged patent right to us.

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we receive from interest-earning assets (e.g., loans and investment securities) and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are volatile and highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, and, in particular the monetary policy of the FOMC. The average yield on our interest-earning assets has increased as the Federal Reserve has started to gradually increase rates after maintaining rates at historically low levels during the financial crisis and its aftermath. As interest rates continue to increase and if our floating rate interest-earning assets do not reprice faster than our interest-bearing liabilities, our net interest income could be adversely affected. If interest rates begin to decline, our net interest income may decrease. This would be the case because our ability to lower our interest expense has been limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets has continued to decrease.",0.040476684,21.042579,52,0.934765334444444

We continue to make progress on the implementation plan and expect to complete the User Acceptance Testing phase of the third party vendor software during FQ1 2020. These ASUs will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses, which could require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, and will likely increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, however, since the magnitude of the anticipated change in the allowance for credit losses will be impacted by economic conditions and trends in our portfolio at the time of adoption, the quantitative impact cannot yet be reasonably determined.",0.040476684,21.042579,52,0.934765334444444

The models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons, including errors in constructing, interpreting or using the models or inaccurate assumptions (e.g., failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner). The errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material, and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See "" - Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk"" for more information on models utilized in credit activities. At September 30, 2019, our agricultural loans, consisting primarily of agricultural operating loans (e.g., loans to farm and ranch owners and operators) and agricultural real estate loans, were $2.01 billion, representing 20.6% of our total loan portfolio. At September 30, 2019, agricultural operating loans totaled $1.05 billion, or 10.8% of our loan portfolio; and agricultural real estate loans totaled $957.6 million, or 9.8%, of our loan portfolio. The primary livestock of our customers to whom we have extended agricultural loans include dairy cows, hogs and feeder cattle, and the primary crops of our customers to whom we have extended agricultural loans include corn, soybeans and, to a lesser extent, wheat and cotton. In addition, we estimate that 8.1% of our commercial non-real estate loans and owner-occupied CRE loans were agriculture-related loans at September 30, 2019.",0.040476684,21.042579,52,0.934765334444444

The conversion rate of the Series C Preferred Units may not be adjusted for all dilutive events. We will incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded partnership, including the cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our public company reporting requirements. Our real property interests generally do not make us contractually responsible for the payment of real property taxes. If the responsible party fails to pay real property taxes, the resulting tax lien could put our real property interest in jeopardy. The tax treatment of REITs, publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our distributable cash flow to our unitholders. Other than the requirement in our partnership agreement to distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we have no legal obligation to make quarterly cash distributions, and our general partner has considerable discretion to establish cash reserves that would reduce the amount of available cash we distribute to unitholders. The Series C preferred units represent perpetual equity interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem the Series C preferred units on the date the Series C preferred units become redeemable by us or on any particular date afterwards. The TCJA is highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the TCJA. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service continue to release regulations relating to and interpretive guidance of the TCJA. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of the TCJA from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business. Our unitholders' share of our income is taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.",0.5390116,19.5884001111111,53,-3.66671395666667

This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units. Upon a conversion in connection with a fundamental change under the Series C Preferred Units, holders of Series C Preferred Units may receive consideration worth less than the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series C Preferred Unit, plus any accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon. Ownership limitations could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction in which unitholders might receive a premium for their partnership interests over the then prevailing market price or which unitholders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest. Our debt service payments will reduce our net income. Moreover, we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy our debt obligations. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our tenants may be exposed to force majeure events and other unforeseen events for which tenant insurance may not provide adequate coverage. Additionally, local restrictions may prevent or inhibit re-building efforts, particularly with outdoor advertising. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us The increased conversion rate for the Series C Preferred Units triggered by a fundamental change could discourage a potential acquiror. We treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.

Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, on June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., 17-494 where the Court held, among other things, that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state, overturning existing court precedent. While we do not expect the Court's decision to have a significant impact on our business, other new or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes could increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the Internet.

Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products.

Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors' actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and other factors.

Additionally, as part of our interim impairment test in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $215 million and a definite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $3 million. As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited), in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and to restate each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 and for fiscal year 2017, following the identification of misstatements as a result of the internal investigation conducted. We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions, suppliers, and procurement employees involved, we determined that it would be appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods. As a result, we have incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.",0.29418433,24.1333478888889,31,-0.718103586666667

We have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives. In addition, certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business, and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts, we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, profitability, financial conditions, and operating results could be adversely affected. In connection with our most recent year-end assessment of internal control over financial reporting, we determined that, as of December 29, 2018, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness in our risk assessment process related to designing and maintaining controls sufficient to appropriately respond to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to material weaknesses arising from (i) supplier contracts and related arrangements, and (ii) goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, and we have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. For further discussion of the material weaknesses identified and our remedial efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may become party to, or threatened with, infringement litigation claims regarding our products and technology, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Moreover, we may become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and technology, including ex parte re-examination, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or foreign patent offices. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of the merit of the claim. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third - party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates or any other of our product candidates or technologies covered by the asserted third - party patents. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such asserted third-party U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Similar challenges exist in other jurisdictions. If we are found to infringe a third-party's valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidates and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non - exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidates. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, we may be forced to redesign our product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals, and indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",0.096313,19.7131838888889,32,3.94775953333333

If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The patent positions of companies engaged in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain as the courts address issues such as patenting genes or gene products. The most recent guidance provided under  Berkheimer v HP, Inc. (April 19, 2018) and Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v West-Ward Pharmaceuticals (June 7, 2018) instruct USPTO examiners on the ramifications of the court rulings as applied to natural products and principles including all naturally occurring nucleic acids. Patents for certain of our product candidates contain claims related to specific DNA sequences that are naturally occurring and, therefore, could be the subject of future challenges made by third parties. In addition, the recent USPTO guidance could make it impossible for us to pursue similar patent claims in patent applications we may prosecute in the future.",0.096313,19.7131838888889,32,3.94775953333333

An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.

1640266,"If one of our licensing partners or we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our technology or one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering such technology or product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of written description or non - enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that an individual connected with prosecution of the patent, including an inventor, an employee of the company, a collaborator or advisor, withheld information material to patentability from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include pre-issuance submissions, ex parte re - examination, post-grant review, inter partes review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Some of these mechanisms may even be exploited anonymously by third parties. Such proceedings could result in the revocation or cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our technology or product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which the patent examiner and we or our licensing partners were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose part or, all of the patent protection on one or more of our product candidates or our supporting technology.

As of December 31, 2018, SBA 7(a) and 504 program loans of $162.4 million comprised 4.4% of our loan portfolio, and we intend to grow this segment of our portfolio in the future. SBA lending programs typically guarantee 75.0% of the principal on an underlying loan. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA-guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us notwithstanding that a portion of the loan was guaranteed by the SBA, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we follow the SBA's underwriting guidelines, our ability to do so depends on the knowledge and diligence of our employees and the effectiveness of controls we have established.

1647513,"In addition, in May 2016, PHMSA proposed rules that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain natural gas lines. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA's current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond ''high consequence areas'' to cover gas pipelines found in newly defined ''moderate consequence areas'' that contain as few as five dwellings within the potential impact area and would also require gas pipelines installed before 1970 that are currently exempted from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their MAOP. Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. The proposed rulemaking also seeks to impose a number of requirements on natural gas gathering lines. Issuance of the final rule remains pending. PHMSA has announced its intention to divide the proposed rule into three parts and issue three separate final rulemakings in 2019. Part I is expected to address the expansion of risk assessment and MAOP requirements (expected issuance in March 2019); Part II is expected to address the expansion of integrity management program regulations (expected issuance in June 2019); and Part III is expected to expand the regulation of gas gathering lines (expected issuance in August 2019). Additionally, in January 2017, PHMSA finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (i.e., periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs), regardless of the pipeline's proximity to a high consequence area. The final rule would also impose new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. However, PHMSA delayed publication due to the change in U.S. Presidential administrations, and the final rule is not expected to be published in the Federal Register until 2019.

On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting energy industry input on how FERC should address income tax allowances in cost-based rates proposed by pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership.  FERC's current policy permits pipelines and storage companies to include a tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates. For pipelines and storage companies owned by partnerships or limited liability company interests, the current tax allowance policy reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the FERC jurisdictional income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. FERC issued the Notice of Inquiry in response to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that FERC had not justified its conclusion that an oil pipeline organized as a partnership would not ""double recover"" its taxes under the current policy by both including a tax allowance in its cost-based rates and earning a return on equity calculated on a pre-tax basis. On March 15, 2018, as clarified on July 18, 2018, in a set of related issuances, FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. To the extent a regulated entity is permitted to include an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service, FERC directed entities to calculate the income tax allowance at the reduced 21% maximum corporate tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. FERC also issued the Revised Policy on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC has noted that to the extent an entity does not include an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates, such entity may elect to also exclude the ADIT balance from the rate calculation.

If we or one of our licensing partners threatened or initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering setmelanotide, the defendant could claim that the patent covering setmelanotide is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any one of several statutory requirements, including novelty, non - obviousness and enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld material information from the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during patent prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re - examination, inter partes review, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, for example, opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents in such a way that they no longer cover setmelanotide or competitive products.

In order to assist in identifying this subset of patients, we employ a genetic diagnostic test, which is a test or measurement that evaluates the presence of genetic variants in a patient. The FDA previously advised that for our clinical trial of setmelanotide to treat POMC deficiency obesity, it will be sufficient to use genetic diagnostic testing known as Sanger bi - directional nucleotide sequencing, as long as that testing is performed by laboratories meeting the standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, for Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs. Currently CMS regulates LDTs and the laboratories that develop them, and enforces CLIA. CMS evaluates whether there is clinical utility for each specific test, and also performs post market oversight of laboratory operational processes. CMS coverage determinations of clinical utility measure the ability of the test to impact clinically meaningful health outcomes, such as mortality or morbidity, through the adoption of efficacious treatments. CMS's oversight through the CLIA program is designed to confirm that a lab assesses analytical validity, but does not confirm whether it had results from an analytical validity assessment that were sufficient to support the claimed intended use of the test. The FDA has issued guidance and has provided comments to members of Congress indicating, however, that in the future it intends to assert jurisdiction over LDTs and to increase regulatory requirements for LDTs. If the FDA does so, the burdens and costs of using LDTs to select patients for setmelanotide could increase, the availability of those LDTs could be negatively affected, and our development program for setmelanotide could be delayed, which in turn could delay or impair our ability to proceed to commercialization.",0.011532365,20.4051666666667,32,3.19440938355556

Additionally, because our in vivo technology potentially involves genome editing across multiple cell and tissue types, we are subject to many of the challenges and risks that other genome editing therapeutics and gene therapies face, including: Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and adversely affect our stock price. Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Product Candidates Changes in tax law may adversely affect our business and financial condition. The manufacturing process used to produce CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo and engineered cell therapy product candidates may be complex, as they are novel and have not been validated for clinical and commercial production. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions; facility unavailability or contamination; raw material cost, shortages or contamination; natural disasters; disruption in utility services; human error; insufficient personnel; inability to meet legal or regulatory requirements; or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. Inconclusive results, lack of efficacy, adverse events or additional safety concerns in clinical trials that we or others conduct may impede the regulatory approval process or overall market acceptance of our future product candidates. Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other genome editing methods as well as small molecules, biologics, in vivo gene therapies, engineered cell therapies (both autologous and allogeneic) and nucleic acid-based therapies for the same indications that we are targeting with our CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. Under our license agreement with Caribou, we sublicense a patent family from The Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna that is co-owned by Dr. Emmanuel Charpentier. The outcome of recent proceedings, as well as potential future proceedings, related to this patent family may affect our ability to utilize the intellectual property sublicensed under our license agreement with Caribou. The price of our common stock historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell any shares of our common stock.

We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business. The CRISPR/Cas9 therapies, whether in vivo or engineered cell therapies, that we intend to develop have not yet been clinically tested by us, and we are not aware of any clinical trials for safety or efficacy having been completed by third parties involving these CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing in vivo products or engineered cell therapies based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology is both preliminary and limited. Successful development of products by us will require solving a number of issues, including developing or obtaining technologies to safely deliver a therapeutic agent into target cells within the human body or engineer human cells while outside of the body such that the modified cells can have a therapeutic effect when delivered to the patient, optimizing the efficacy and specificity of such products, and ensuring the therapeutic selectivity, efficacy and safety of such products.

Third parties may raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of, or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or other technologies. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensing partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates or other technologies. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.",0.0,21.4365526666667,32,3.04002357111111
1653087,"The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If the scope of any patent protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to prevent our competitors from commercializing similar or identical technology and product candidates would be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We will need to obtain substantial additional financing to complete the development and any commercialization of our product candidates, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our commercialization efforts, product development, or other operations.

For example, if Station Holdco makes distributions to Red Rock, our Continuing Owners will also be entitled to receive distributions pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective LLC Units and their preferences as to the timing and amount of any such distributions may differ from those of our public shareholders. Our Continuing Owners may also have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, especially in light of the existence of the TRA, whether and when to incur new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, and whether and when Red Rock should terminate the TRA and accelerate its obligations thereunder. The structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these Continuing Owners' tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.

Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars.  We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.  However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.

In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems immediately or in short order. We may not be able to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers, especially during peak usage times and as our products become more complex and our user traffic increases. For example, in October 2016, a distributed denial-of-service attack against Dyn, a domain name service vendor we use (since acquired by Oracle), prevented many of our customers and their users in the United States from accessing our platform or applications authenticated by our platform and resulted in our failing to meet certain contracted uptime levels under our service level agreements and the issuance of service credits to some of our customers, although the dollar value of such credits were not material. If our platform is unavailable or if our customers are unable to access our products or deploy them within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business would be harmed. Since our customers rely on our service to access and complete their work, any outage on our platform would impair the ability of our customers to perform their work, which would negatively impact our brand, reputation and customer satisfaction. Moreover, we depend on services from various third parties to maintain our infrastructure and distribute our products via the Internet. If a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform or otherwise experiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers' access to our service, which could adversely affect their perception of our platform's reliability and our revenues. Any disruptions in these services, including as a result of actions outside of our control, would significantly impact the continued performance of our products.

Further, we may be subject to audits and investigations regarding our governmental contracts, and any violations could result in penalties and sanctions, including termination of the contract, refunding or forfeiting payments, fines and suspension or disbarment from future government business.  Selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale. Government entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated, require preferential pricing, termination rights tied to funding availability or ""most favored nation"" terms and conditions, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. Government entities may also have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our partners for convenience, for lack of funding, or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations.  If we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators or termination rights. Even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our service to government entities could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our service to them and to grow or maintain our customer base.

Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends and continue to enhance existing products or introduce or acquire new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement or new product depends on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhancement or new product. Any new product we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours at lower prices.

The performance of our Energy Servers may be affected by factors outside of our control, which could result in harm to our business and financial results. The market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations and policies as well as by internal policies and regulations of electric utility providers. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. These regulations and policies are often modified and could continue to change, which could result in a significant reduction in demand for our Energy Servers. For example, utility companies commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could change, thereby increasing the cost to our customers of using our Energy Servers and making them less economically attractive. In addition, our project with Delmarva Power & Light Company (""Delmarva"") is subject to laws and regulations relating to electricity generation, transmission, and sale such as Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") regulation under various federal energy regulatory laws, which requires FERC authorization to make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services.

We expect that oppositions will be filed in the European Patent Office, or EPO, and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions.

Our current product candidates include natural products, therefore, this decision and its interpretation by the courts and the USPTO may impact prosecution, defense and enforcement of our patent portfolio. In Myriad, the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA, or cDNA, molecules, which are not genomic sequences, may be patent eligible because they are not a natural product. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain. However, on March 4, 2014, the USPTO issued a memorandum to patent examiners providing guidance for examining claims that recite laws of nature, natural phenomena or natural products under the Myriad and Prometheus decisions. The guidance did not limit the application of Myriad to DNA but, rather, applied the decision broadly to other natural products, which may include our product candidates.

Because the cash that we receive from the lender when we initially sell the assets to the lender is less than the value of those assets (the difference being the ""haircut""), if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same assets back to us, we would incur a loss on the repurchase agreement equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). We would also incur losses on a repurchase agreement if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of the repurchase agreement term, because we would have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive assets worth less than that amount.

Floating rate loans earn interest at rates that adjust from time to time (typically monthly) based upon an index (typically one-month LIBOR). These floating rate loans are insulated from changes in value specifically due to changes in interest rates; however, the coupons they earn fluctuate based upon interest rates (again, typically one-month LIBOR) and, in a declining and/or low interest rate environment, these loans will earn lower rates of interest and this will impact our operating performance.

Fixed interest rate loans, however, do not have adjusting interest rates and the relative value of the fixed cash flows from these loans will decrease as prevailing interest rates rise or increase as prevailing interest rates fall, causing potentially significant changes in value. We may employ various hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates (and in some cases credit spreads), including engaging in interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate derivative products. We believe that no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate changes and there is a risk that such strategies may provide no protection at all and potentially compound the impact of changes in interest rates. Hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, leverage risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and a change in current period expense. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to enter into hedging transactions or that such hedging transactions will adequately protect us against the foregoing risks.",0.76065391,20.3030316666667,52,-8.57422497222222
1703644,"Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and satisfying the criteria for no-action relief from the CFTC's Commodity Pool Operator, or CPO, registration rules, there are no current limitations on the hedging transactions that we may undertake. Our hedging transactions could require us to fund large cash payments in certain circumstances (e.g., the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or a demand by a counterparty that we make increased margin payments). Excess inclusion income arises from holding the REMIC residual interests or the equity interest in certain securitization structures. It could arise, for example, if we issued debt obligations with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments received on mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities pledged to secure those debt obligations, i.e., if we were to own an equity interest in a ""taxable mortgage pool"". We could also have excess inclusion income if we hold a residual interest in a REMIC. While we do not now own such equity interests or residual interests or expect to acquire significant amounts of residual interests in REMICs or taxable mortgage pools, it is possible that we may do so in the future.  Doing so would cause us to be treated as having excess inclusion income, although we do not anticipate that the amount of any such excess inclusion income would be substantial.

We would expect to retain all or a portion of the equity and potentially other tranches in the securitized pool of loans or investments. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future retain a pari passu participations in some or all of the securitized loans. Investments in CMBS, CLOs and other similar structured finance investments, as well as those we structure, sponsor or arrange, pose additional risks, including the risks of the securitization process and the risk that the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interests.

Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our investments may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed.

This is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from CEOC pursuant to the formation transactions as well as certain other properties we have acquired and may acquire in the future. If we dispose of any such properties during the five-year period following acquisition of the properties from the respective C corporation (i.e., during the five-year period following ownership of such properties by a REIT), we will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax (and applicable state and local taxes) at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a tax-deferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains.

If sea levels were to rise, we may incur material costs to protect our low-lying assets (to the extent not covered by our tenants under the terms of our leases) or may sustain damage, a decrease in value or total loss of such assets. In addition, climate change may result in reduced economic activity in these areas, which could harm the operations of our tenants and reduce the demand at our properties, which could reduce the rent payable to us under our triple-net leases and make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties on favorable lease terms.  Furthermore, our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the threat of climate change or the effects of climate change may not be covered by our insurance policies.

If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio, or contribute to a TRS, or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.

As a result, stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received, if any. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale.

Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Preclinical development is uncertain.

Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.

Ch.), some companies that have adopted similar federal district court forum selection provisions were sued in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by stockholders who assert that those federal district court forum selection provisions are not enforceable. On December 19, 2018, Court of Chancery issued a decision in Sciabacucchi declaring that provisions in certificates of incorporation of Delaware companies that purport to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are ineffective and invalid under Delaware law. On January 17, 2019, the decision was appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court. While the Delaware Supreme Court recently dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional grounds, we expect that the appeal will be re-filed after the Court of Chancery issues a final judgment. Unless and until the Court of Chancery's decision in Sciabacucchi is reversed or otherwise abrogated, we do not intend to enforce its Federal Forum Provision designating the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for Securities Act claims. In the event that the Delaware Supreme Court affirms the Court of Chancery's Sciabacucchi decision or otherwise makes a determination that provisions such as the Federal Forum Provision are invalid, our Board of Directors intends to amend promptly the Company's bylaws to remove the Federal Forum Provision. Such amendment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our use of pre-dispute arbitration provisions will remain dependent on whether courts continue to enforce these provisions. We take the position that the Federal Arbitration Act (the ""FAA"") requires that arbitration agreements containing class action waivers of the type we use be enforced in accordance with their terms. In the past, a number of courts, including the California and Nevada Supreme Courts, have concluded that arbitration agreements with class action waivers are ""unconscionable"" and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis. However, in April 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion held that the FAA preempts state laws that would otherwise invalidate consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers. Our arbitration agreements differ in some respects from the agreement at issue in Concepcion, and some courts have continued to find reasons to find arbitration agreements unenforceable following the Concepcion decision. Thus, it is possible that one or more courts could use the differences between our arbitration agreements and the agreement at issue in Concepcion as a basis for a refusal to enforce our arbitration agreements, particularly if such courts are hostile to our kind of lending or to pre-dispute mandatory consumer arbitration agreements. Further, Judicial decisions or new legislation could potentially render our arbitration agreements unenforceable.

The risks described below are not the only risks that Perspecta currently faces. Misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws and regulations, including the Procurement Integrity Act and anti-corruption laws. Other examples could include the failure to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics (The Standard), policies and procedures or with U.S. federal, state or local government procurement regulations, rules regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, international trade controls (particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations), lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations.

Sales and use, value-added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. One or more states or countries may seek to impose additional sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair that a U.S. state may require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to the state's residents may permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes on our platform could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage customers from purchasing our platform, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may acquire other companies or technologies which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations. We expect that the payments that we will be required to make to the TRA Members will be substantial. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and therefore may accelerate payments due under the TRA. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the TRA.

1725579,"If the IRS challenges the tax basis or other tax attributes that give rise to payments under the TRA and the tax basis or other tax attributes are subsequently required to be adjusted, generally the recipients of payments under the TRA will not reimburse us for any payments we previously made to them. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Member will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the TRA. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the TRA and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the TRA that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.

1725579,"If and when we generate taxable income, Pluralsight Holdings will generally make quarterly tax distributions to each of its members, including us, based on each member's allocable share of net taxable income (calculated under certain assumptions) multiplied by an assumed tax rate. The assumed tax rate for this purpose will be the highest effective marginal combined federal, state, and local income tax rate that may potentially apply to any member for the applicable fiscal year. The Tax Act recently significantly reduced the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable to corporations such as Pluralsight, Inc., relative to non-corporate taxpayers. As a result of this disparity, we expect to receive tax distributions from Pluralsight Holdings significantly in excess of our actual tax liability and our obligations under the TRA, which could result in our accumulating a significant amount of cash. This would complicate our ability to maintain certain aspects of our capital structure. Such cash, if retained, could cause the value of an LLC Unit to deviate from the value of a share of Class A common stock, contrary to the one-to-one relationship described in the section titled ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Fourth Amended and Restated LLC Agreement"", which is incorporated by reference to our 2019 Proxy Statement, for additional information. In addition, such cash, if used to purchase additional LLC Units, could result in deviation from the one-to-one relationship between Class A common stock outstanding and LLC Units of Pluralsight Holdings held by Pluralsight, Inc. unless a corresponding number of additional shares of Class A common stock are distributed as a stock dividend. We may choose to pay dividends to all holders of Class A common stock with any excess cash. These considerations could have unintended impacts on the pricing of our Class A common stock and may impose transaction costs and require management efforts to address on a recurring basis. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to Pluralsight Holdings, the Continuing Members in Pluralsight Holdings during a period in which we hold such cash balances could benefit from the value attributable to such cash balances as a result of redeeming or exchanging their LLC Units and obtaining ownership of Class A common stock (or a cash payment based on the value of Class A common stock). In such case, these Continuing Members could receive disproportionate value for their LLC Units exchanged during this time frame.",0.47206315,21.0847972222222,51,1.54951762

As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Skonnard is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Because Mr. Skonnard, personally and through his associated entities, holds his economic interest in our business primarily through Pluralsight Holdings, rather than through the public company, he may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, Mr. Skonnard may have a different tax position from us, which could influence his decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the TRA, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control within the meaning of the TRA or terminate the TRA. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See the section titled ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement"" incorporated by reference to our 2019 Proxy Statement for additional information. In addition, Mr. Skonnard's significant ownership in us and resulting ability to effectively control or significantly influence us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price.

See the section titled ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement"" incorporated by reference to our 2019 Proxy Statement for additional information. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the trading market for the Class A common stock. The TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the TRA, then the TRA will terminate and our obligations, or our successor's obligations, to make future payments under the TRA would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the TRA to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the TRA as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control.

1725579,"Our principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Pluralsight Holdings. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue. Pluralsight Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its LLC Units, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Pluralsight Holdings and also incur expenses related to our operations. Pursuant to the Fourth LLC Agreement, Pluralsight Holdings will make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations in respect of the cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative taxable losses of Pluralsight Holdings that is allocated to them, to the extent previous tax distributions from Pluralsight Holdings have been insufficient. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, plus payments under the TRA, which we expect could be significant given the tax benefits associated with exchanges of LLC Units are more-likely-than-not to be realized. We intend to cause Pluralsight Holdings to make distributions or, in the case of certain expenses, payments in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments due under the TRA. However, Pluralsight Holdings' ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations (as a result of Pluralsight Holdings' inability to make distributions due to various limitations and restrictions or as a result of the acceleration of our obligations under the TRA), we may have to borrow funds and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, many companies' accounting policies and practices are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, the accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements.

Sanofi, the Federal Circuit held that a well characterized antigen is insufficient to satisfy the written description requirement of certain claims directed to a genus of antibodies that are solely defined by function.

1739104,"We face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. We depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the jurisdictions where such patents are obtained. The extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents, the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable jurisdiction. In 2018, approximately 72% of our revenue was from products that did not have patent protection, including revenue from some of our top products such as Rumensin, Maxiban, Denagard and Tylan Premix. Other products are protected by patents that expire over the next several years. For example, certain patents related to Trifexis expire as early as 2020 in the U.S., 2021 in Japan and 2025 in European territories. As the patents for a brand name product expire, competitors may begin to introduce generic or other alternatives, and as a result, we may face competition from lower - priced alternatives to many of our products. For example, we have experienced significant competitive headwinds from generic ractopamine in the U.S. In the third quarter of 2013, a large established animal health company received U.S. approval for generic ractopamine. U.S. revenue from Optaflexx, our ractopamine beef product, has declined at a CAGR of 24% from 2015 to 2018 as a result of generic competition and international regulatory restrictions. We may face similar competition in the future for existing products that do not benefit from exclusivity, including Rumensin, which has not benefitted from patent protection in the U.S. for over 20 years, or for existing products with material patents expiring in the future.

1739104,"In addition, our revenue has been impacted by regulatory changes in China and other markets restricting the use of productivity products, such as those containing ractopamine, in food animals. This has resulted in many U.S. food producers who access such markets eliminating their use of ractopamine. Our FA Ruminants & Swine products Optaflexx and Paylean contain ractopamine. If more producers decide to access such markets or additional markets restrict the use of ractopamine or other productivity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If any of our top products experience issues, such as disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective competitive products, negative publicity, changes to veterinarian or customer preferences, loss of patent protection, material product liability litigation, new or unexpected side effects, manufacturing disruptions and/or regulatory proceedings, our revenue could be negatively impacted, perhaps significantly. Our top five products, Rumensin, Trifexis, Maxiban, Denagard and Interceptor Plus, contributed approximately 31% of our revenue in 2018.

As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States continues to adapt to wide-ranging patent reform legislation that became effective starting in 2012. Moreover, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable.

The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for U.S. applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. We cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes. We may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or all of the term of certain patent applications.

While these post grant review proceedings have been used less frequently to invalidate biotech patents, they have been successful regarding other technologies, and these relatively new procedures are still changing, and those changes might affect future results. No assurance can be given that if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable or that even if found valid and enforceable, a competitor's technology or product would be found by a court to infringe our patents.

A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences.

In addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, portable digital video devices and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and technologies allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements.
